<p class='c007'>In one of your states two men, Sacco and Vanzetti, have
been convicted for a crime of opinion.</p>

  <h2 class='c006'><i>EUGENE V. DEBS TO THE WORKERS OF AMERICA</i></h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'><i>Gene Debs is dead. Gene Debs lives in the hearts and
minds of millions of Americans. This is his last appeal for
justice.</i></p>

<p class='c007'>The supreme court of Massachusetts has spoken at last and
Bartolomeo Vanzetti and Nicola Sacco, two of the bravest and best
scouts that ever served the labor movement, must go to the electric
chair.</p>

<p class='c007'>The decision of this capitalist judicial tribunal is not
surprising. It accords perfectly with the tragical farce and the
farcical tragedy of the entire trial of these two absolutely
innocent and shamefully persecuted working men.</p>

<p class='c007'>The evidence at the trial in which they were charged with a
murder they had no more to do with committing than I had, would
have convicted no one but a “foreign labor agitator” in the
hydrophobic madness of the world war. In any other case the
perjured and flagrantly made-to-order testimony, repeatedly
exposed and well known to the court, would have resulted in
instantaneous acquittal. Not even a sheep-killing dog but only
a “vicious foreign-radical” could have been convicted under such
shameless evidence.</p>

<p class='c007'>Sacco and Vanzetti were framed and doomed from the start.
Not all the testimony that could have been piled up to establish
their innocence beyond a question of doubt could have saved them
in that court. The trial judge was set and immovable. There
must be a conviction. It was so ordained by the capitalist
powers that be, and it had to come. And there must be no new
trial granted lest the satanic perjury of the testimony and the
utter rottenness of the proceedings appear too notoriously rank
and revolting in spite of the conspiracy of the press to keep the
public in ignorance of the disgraceful and damaging facts.</p>

<p class='c007'>Aside from the disgustingly farcical nature of the trial which
could and should have ended in fifteen minutes in that masterclass
court, the refined malice and barbaric cruelty of these
capitalist tribunals, high and low, may be<a id='t007'></a> read in the insufferable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>torture inflicted thru six long, agonizing years upon their
imprisoned and helpless victims.</p>

<p class='c007'>It would have been merciful to the last degree in comparison
had they been boiled in oil, burned at the stake, or had every
joint torn from their bodies on the wheel when they were first
seized as prey to glut the vengeance of slave drivers, who wax
fat and savage in child labor and who never forgive an “agitator”
who is too rigidly honest to be bribed, too courageous to be
intimidated, and too defiant to be suppressed.</p>

<p class='c007'>And that is precisely why the mill-owning, labor-sweating
malefactors of Massachusetts had Sacco and Vanzetti framed,
pounced upon, thrown into a dungeon, and sentenced to be
murdered by their judicial and other official underlings.</p>

<p class='c007'>I appeal to the working men and women of America
to think of these two loyal comrades, these two honest, clean-hearted
brothers of ours, in this fateful hour in which they stand
face to face with their bitter and ignominious doom.</p>

<p class='c007'>The capitalist courts of Massachusetts have had them on the
rack day and night, devouring the flesh of their bodies and
torturing their souls for six long years to finally deal the last
vicious, heartless blow, aimed to send them to their graves as
red-handed felons and murderers.</p>

<p class='c007'>Would that it were in my power to make that trial judge
and those cold-blooded gowns in the higher court suffer for just
one day the agonizing torture, the pitiless misery, the relentless
cruelty they have inflicted in their stony-hearted “judicial
calmness and serenity” upon Sacco and Vanzetti thru six endless
years!</p>

<p class='c007'>Perhaps some day these solemn and begowned servants of
the ruling powers may have to atone for their revolting crime
against innocence in the name of justice!</p>

<p class='c007'>They have pronounced the doom of their long suffering victims
and the press declares that the last word has been spoken. I
deny it.</p>

<p class='c007'>There is another voice yet to be heard and that is the voice
of an outraged working class. It is for labor now to speak and
for the labor movement to announce its decision, and that decision
is and must be, SACCO AND VANZETTI ARE INNOCENT
AND SHALL NOT DIE!</p>

<p class='c007'>To allow these two intrepid proletarian leaders to perish as
red-handed criminals would forever disgrace the cause of labor
in the United States. The countless children of generations yet
to come would blush for their sires and grand sires and never
forgive their cowardice and poltroonery.</p>

<p class='c007'>It cannot be possible, and I shall not think it possible, that
the American workers will desert, betray and deliver to their
executioner two men who have stood as staunchly true, as
unflinchingly loyal in the cause of labor as have Sacco and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>Vanzetti, whose doom has been pronounced by the implacable
enemies of the working class.</p>

<p class='c007'>Now is the time for all labor to be aroused and to rally as
one vast host to vindicate its assailed honor, to assert its self-respect,
and to issue its demand that in spite of the capitalist-controlled
courts of Massachusetts honest and innocent workingmen
whose only crime is their innocence of crime and their
loyalty to labor, shall not be murdered by the official hirelings
of the corporate powers that rule and tyrannize over the state.</p>

<p class='c007'>It does not matter what the occupation of the worker may
be, what he is in theory of belief, what union or party he belongs
to, this is the supreme cause of us all and the call comes to each
of us and to all of us to unite from coast to coast in every state
and thruout the whole country to protest in thunder tones against
the consummation of that foul and damning crime against labor
in the once proud state of Massachusetts.</p>

<p class='c007'>A thousand protest meetings should be called at once and
ring with denunciation of the impending crime.</p>

<p class='c007'>A million letters of indignant resentment should roll in on
the governor of Massachusetts and upon members of the house
of representatives and the senate of the United States.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is this, and this alone, that will save Sacco and Vanzetti.
We cannot ignore this duty to ourselves, to our martyr comrades,
to our cause, to justice and humanity without being guilty of
treason to our own manhood and outraging our own souls.</p>

<p class='c007'>Arouse ye toiling millions of the nation and swear by all
you hold sacred in the cause of labor and in the cause of truth and
justice and all things of good report, that Sacco and Vanzetti,
your brothers and mine, innocent as we are, shall not be foully
murdered to glut the vengeance of a gang of plutocratic slave
drivers!</p>

  <h2 class='c006'><i>AMERICAN FEDERATION OF LABOR DEMANDS INVESTIGATION</i></h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'><i>On October 11th, 1926, the American Federation of Labor
Convention in Detroit, representing millions of working men
passed the following resolution proposing that the American
Federation of Labor demand an investigation of the activities of
agents of the Department of Justice in the Sacco-Vanzetti case.</i></p>

<p class='c007'>Resolution No. 74.—By Delegate Samuel Squibb, International
Granite Cutters’ Union.</p>

<p class='c010'>WHEREAS, The case of Sacco and Vanzetti has again
come before the public; and</p>

<p class='c010'>WHEREAS, After six years of imprisonment those who
take an interest in this case are now more convinced than ever
that Sacco and Vanzetti are not guilty of the crime they were
charged with and convicted for; and</p>

<p class='c010'>WHEREAS, The motion for a new trial based on newly
discovered evidence, primarily on the confession of Celestino F.
Madeiros, is now before the court of Massachusetts; and</p>

<p class='c010'>WHEREAS, On this motion for a new trial, affidavits of
former agents of the Department of Justice of the United States
have been produced that show that there are records on file in the
office of the Department of Justice, establishing the fact that
there was collaboration between the Department of Justice and
the District Attorney of Norfolk County to convict Sacco and
Vanzetti on charges of a crime, of which the Department of
Justice did not believe them guilty; and</p>

<p class='c010'>WHEREAS, The Attorney General has refused access to
the records in the case to the Counsel for the Defense, in spite of
his urgent request for the same; and</p>

<p class='c010'>WHEREAS, A large number of the International Unions
affiliated with the American Federation of Labor are deeply
interested in the case of Sacco and Vanzetti and have by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>resolutions adopted at their conventions, expressed the sentiment
of their members on this matter; be it, therefore</p>

<p class='c010'>RESOLVED, That the American Federation of Labor in
convention assembled demand an immediate investigation by the
Congress of the United States of the actions of the agents of the
Department of Justice; the connection of Department of Justice
with the conviction of Sacco and Vanzetti; and the refusal of
the Department of Justice to disclose its files on the Sacco and
Vanzetti case; be it further</p>

<p class='c010'>RESOLVED, That copies of this resolution be sent to the
President and Congress of the United States.</p>

<p class='c007'>The convention of the American Federation of Labor of last
year and of several years prior thereto have repeatedly declared
that Sacco and Vanzetti should be accorded a new trial in order
that no man’s life may be placed in jeopardy without a just
and fair trial and be found guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.
This insistence for a new trial was predicated on the doubt of
many as to the guilt of these men and because of the belief that
the enforcement of this decision without a retrial and a full and
complete opportunity to present all possible evidence having come
to light either as to the guilt or innocence of these men would
be a miscarriage of justice.</p>

<p class='c007'>The resolution presented indicates or at least raises a doubt
that evidence has been or is being withheld by the Department of
Justice relating to the guilt or innocence of these men. This
in itself places the Department of Justice into serious question.
It adds further doubt as to the guilt or innocence of the men
charged and found guilty of crime. Regardless of the character
or attitude of mind of these men toward our government or its
institutions as a people we are deeply concerned that the power
of government, or that of any of its departments shall at
no time be used unconstitutionally to jeopardize the life and
liberty of any person. And because of the serious charge thus
made we recommend reaffirmation of our former demand for a
retrial and reference of this resolution to the Executive Council,
with directions that it proceed immediately to inquire into the
charge made and to have determined the truth or falsity of this
charge by Congressional investigation, if that be necessary.</p>

<p class='c007'>The report of the committee was adopted by unanimous
vote.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span></div>
<div class='border'>

<p class='c009'>“The department of Justice in Boston
was anxious to get sufficient evidence against
Sacco and Vanzetti to deport them but never
succeeded in getting the kind and amount of
evidence required for that purpose. It was
the opinion of the department agents here
that a conviction of Sacco and Vanzetti for
murder would be one way of disposing of the
two men. It was also the general opinion
of such of the agents in Boston as had any
actual knowledge of the Sacco-Vanzetti case;
that Sacco and Vanzetti, although anarchists
and agitators, were not highway robbers
and had nothing to do with the South
Braintree crime. My opinion and the opinion
of most of the older men in the government

<p class='c009'>“By calling these men anarchists, I do not
mean necessarily that they were inclined to

am also thoroughly convinced and always
have been, and I believe that is the opinion
and always has been the opinion of such
Boston agents of the Department of Justice

these men had nothing whatever to do with

  <h2 class='c006'>FACING THE CHAIR</h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span><i>The evening of May 5th, 1920, Nicola Sacco, an Italian,
working as edger in a shoe factory, and Bartolomeo Vanzetti,
also an Italian, a fishpeddler, were arrested in a streetcar in
Brockton, Massachusetts. The two men were known as radicals
and were active in Italian working class organizations in the
vicinity of Boston. In Sacco’s pocket at the time of his arrest
was a draft of a handbill calling a meeting to protest against
the illegal imprisonment and possible murder of Salsedo by
agents of the Department of Justice. Salsedo was the anarchist
printer whose body was found smashed on the pavement of Park
Row under the windows of the New York offices of the Department
of Justice, where he and his friend Elia had been held
without warrant for eight weeks of the third degree. Sacco
and Vanzetti were armed when arrested and lied when
questioned about their friends and associates. It came out later
that they had been trying to get the Overland car of a man
named Boda out of a garage in order to go about the country to
their friends’ houses warning them of a new series of red raids
they had been tipped off to expect. At the same time they were
collecting radical newspapers and any literature that might seem
suspicious to the police. They were arrested, because the
garage-owner phoned the police, having been warned to notify
them of the movements of any Italians who owned automobiles.</i></p>

<p class='c007'><i>A couple of weeks before, the afternoon of April 15, a
peculiarly impudent and brutal crime had been committed in
South Braintree, a nearby town, the climax of a long series of
holdups and burglaries. Bandits after shooting down a paymaster
and his guard in the center of the town had escaped in
a Buick touring car with over fifteen thousand dollars in cash.
It was generally rumored that the bandits were most of them
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>Italians. The police had made a great fuss but found no clue
to the identity of the murderers. Public feeling was bitter and
critical. A victim had to be found. To prove the murderers to
have been reds would please everybody. So first Vanzetti was
taken over to Plymouth and tried as one of the men who had
attempted to hold up a paytruck in Bridgewater early in the
morning of the previous Christmas Eve. He was convicted and
sentenced to fifteen years imprisonment. Plymouth is owned
by the largest cordage works in the world. Several years before
Vanzetti had been active in a successful strike against the
Cordage. Then he was taken to Dedham and tried with Sacco
for the murder of the paymaster and his guard killed in South
Braintree. After a stormy trial they were convicted of murder
in the first degree. Since then sentence has been stayed by a
series of motions for a new trial. One appeal to the Supreme
Judicial Court of Massachusetts has been refused and another
is pending.</i></p>

<p class='c007'><i>The most important evidence that has come up in the course
of the motions is the series of affidavits procured by the defense,
proving, as the labor press has always claimed, that operatives
of the Department of Justice were active in the trial, and lacking
evidence on which to deport Sacco and Vanzetti as radicals,
helped in the frameup by which they were convicted as
murderers.</i></p>

<p class='c007'><i>“They were bad actors anyway and got what was coming
to them,” one detective is quoted as saying. That means that
any man who gives up his life to the hope of humanizing the
treadmill of industry is a bad actor in the minds of the governing
class and governing class police. Sacco and Vanzetti are not
the only men who have been framed, but they have become
symbols. All over the world people are hopefully, heartbrokenly
watching the Sacco-Vanzetti Case as a focus in the unending
fight for human rights of oppressed individuals and masses
against oppressing individuals and masses.</i></p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>
  <h2 class='c006'>I<br> WHERE THE CASE STANDS TODAY</h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>On October 23rd 1926 Judge Webster Thayer handed down
his decision on the latest motions for a new trial, argued by the
defense during the week of September 13th. The decision is a
document of something more than thirty thousand words in
length. A reader unskilled in the technique of legal judgment
gets the impression that the document is more of a personal
apologium and defense on the part of the court than the impartial
decision of a judge. Not a spark of scientific spirit, or of the
consciousness of the infinite possibilities of human error has
edged its way into those long involved sentences.</p>

<p class='c007'>The confession of Madeiros and the elaborate circumstantial
case evolved from it by the defense, tending to prove that the
South Braintree holdup was committed by members of the
Morelli gang of Providence, is dismissed with the following
statement:</p>

<p class='c011'>In conclusion, in so far as the Madeiros affidavit is concerned,
it would have been an easy task for this court to transfer the
responsibility upon another jury, but if this were done it would
be the shirking of a solemn duty that the law places upon the
trial court. Guided by this solemn duty I have examined and
studied for several weeks without interruption, the record of the
testimony upon this motion and upon the Madeiros deposition;
and being controlled only by judgment, reason, and conscience,
and after giving as favorable consideration to these defendants
as may be consistent with a due regard for the rights of the
public and sound principles of law, I am forced to the conclusion
that the affidavit of Madeiros is unreliable, untrustworthy and
untrue. To set aside the verdict of a jury affirmed by the
Supreme Judicial Court of this commonwealth on such an
affidavit would be a mockery upon truth and justice. Therefore,
exercising every right vested in this court in the granting of
motions for new trials by the law of this commonwealth, the
motion for a new trial is hereby denied.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>Further on in this comment upon the plea that Department
of Justice agents worked with the prosecution to obtain conviction
for murder against Sacco and Vanzetti although they
considered them to be innocent (based on the now famous
affidavits of Letherman and Weyand):</p>

<p class='c011'>Cases cannot be decided on the ground of public opinion, but
upon reason, judgment, and in accordance with law; for cases
cannot be decided on mystery, suspicion or propaganda but upon
the actual evidence that is introduced at the trial. If this were
otherwise God help the poor defendants in criminal cases, if they
are to be acquitted and convicted, not upon evidence and the
law, but upon public opinion, which might be formed as the
result of an unwarranted public opinion or propaganda.</p>

<p class='c007'>This might seem to the unlegal mind of a man smoking a
cigar at a street corner, a knife that cuts two ways. To continue
further on:</p>

<p class='c011'>Have Attorney General Sargent of the United States and his
subordinates and former Attorney General Palmer under the
administration of President Wilson (for most of the correspondence
took place under President Wilson’s administration)
stooped so low and are they so degraded that they were willing,
by the concealment of evidence to enter into a fraudulent
conspiracy with the government of Massachusetts to send two
men to the electric chair, not because they were murderers, but
because they were radicals?</p>

<p class='c007'>Judge Thayer answers, No. But will that be the verdict
of fairminded men and women when the full truth of this case
is known? Will that be the verdict of workingmen the world
over who see their own image in Sacco and Vanzetti? In the face
of the evidence as it stands would a plain mind, free from legal
technicalities and sectional bitterness answer No?</p>

<p class='c007'>This decision leaves one more chance of appeal to the
Supreme Judicial Court before sentence, but as that court makes
decisions only on points of law and not on the human merits of
a case, the hope of reversal is slim. After that the only appeal
is to executive clemency, or to the Supreme Court of the United
States on the plea that the defendants were convicted without due
process of law. A pretty forlorn hope.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>Sacco and Vanzetti are not asking for pardon, they are
asking for justice. Remember that when it became evident that
Tom Mooney was innocent of the Preparedness Parade bombing
for which he had been convicted in California, instead of his
being freed, his sentence was commuted to life. He is still in
jail a victim of executive clemency.</p>

<p class='c007'>Sacco and Vanzetti want justice, not clemency.</p>

<p class='c007'>Only an immense surge of protest from all classes and
conditions of men can save them from the Chair.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c006'>II<br> THE HEARING OF THE SEVENTH MOTION</h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Another hearing of a motion for a new trial. Six have
been denied so far. Sacco and Vanzetti have been six years in
jail. This time there are no guards with riotguns, no state
troopers riding round the courthouse. No excitement of any sort.
Everyone has forgotten the great days of the Red Conspiracy,
the passion to sustain law and order against the wave of
radicalism, against foreigners, and the ‘moral rats gnawing at
the foundations of the commonwealth’ that Attorney General
Palmer spoke of so eloquently. In this court there are no
prisoners in a cage, no hysterical witnesses, no credulous jury
under the sign of the screaming eagle. Quiet, dignity; almost
like a class in a lawschool. The case has been abstracted into
a sort of mathematics. Only the lawyers for the defense and
for the prosecution, Ranney from the District Attorney’s office,
Thompson and Ehrmann for the defense, two small tables of
newspaper men, on the benches a few Italians, some professional
liberals and radicals, plainclothes men with rumpsteak faces
occupying the end seats.</p>

<p class='c007'>The court attendants make everybody get up. The Judge
comes in on the heels of a man in a blue uniform. Judge
Thayer is a very small man with a little grey lined shingle face,
nose glasses tilting out at the top across a sudden little hawknose.
He walks with a firm bustling tread. The black gown that
gives him the power of life and death (the gown of majesty of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>the blind goddess the law) sticks out a little behind. Another
attendant walks after him. The judge climbs up to his high
square desk. The judge speaks. His voice crackles dryly as
old papers.</p>

<p class='c007'>Affidavits, affidavits read alternately by counsel in the
stillness of the yellowvarnished courtroom. Gradually as the
reading goes on the courtroom shrinks. Tragic figures of men
and women grow huge like shadows cast by a lantern on a wall;
the courtroom becomes a tiny pinhole through which to see a
world of huge trampling forces in conflict.</p>

<p class='c007'>First it’s the story of the life of Celestino Madeiros, a poor
Portuguese boy brought up in New Bedford. He learned
Americanism all right, he suffered from no encumbering ideas
of social progress; the law of dawg eat dawg was morbidly vivid
in his mind from the first. Hardly out of school he was up in
court for ‘breaking and entering’. No protests from him about
the war. He and his sister and another man dressed up in
uniform and collected money for some vaguely phoney patriotic
society, The American Rescue League. By the spring of 1920
he was deep in the criminal world that is such an apt cartoon
of the world of legitimate business. He was making good. He
was in with the Morelli brothers of Providence, a gang of
freight-car robbers, bootleggers, pimps, hijackers and miscellaneous
thugs. The great wave of highway robbery that followed
the war was at its height. For three years the leaders of
society had been proclaiming the worthlessness of human life.
Is it surprising that criminals should begin to take them at their
word?</p>

<p class='c007'>Scared to death, blind drunk, Madeiros, an overgrown boy
of eighteen, was in the back seat of the Buick touring car that
carried off the tragic holdup outside the Rice and Hutchins
shoefactory at South Braintree. Probably on his share of the
payroll he went south, once he got out of the Rhode Island jail
where another episode of breaking and entering had landed
him. He came back north with his money spent and worked
as a bouncer at the Bluebird Inn, a ‘disorderly’ road house at
Seekonk, Mass. and fell at last into the clutches of the
Massachusetts law through a miserable failure to duplicate the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>daring South Braintree holdup at Wrentham, where he shot an
aged bank cashier and ran without trying to get any loot. At
his trial he sat so hunched and motionless that he seemed an
imbecile. Not even when his mother threw an epileptic fit in
the courtroom and was carried out rigid and foaming did he look
up. At the Dedham jail he was put in the cell next to Sacco.
He could see Sacco going out to meet his wife and kids when
they came to see him. The idea of an innocent man going to
the chair worried him. For him everything had crashed. It
had been on his own confession that he had been convicted of
the Wrentham murder. He seems to have puzzled for a long
time to find some way of clearing Sacco and Vanzetti without
inculpating his old associates, even though he had fallen out
with them long ago. He tried to tell Sacco about it in the jail
bathroom, but Sacco, seeing Department of Justice spies everywhere—and
with good reason—wouldn’t listen to him. So at
last he sent the warden a written confession asking him to
forward it to the <cite>Boston American</cite>. Nothing happened. The
warden kept his mouth shut. Eventually he sent a new confession
to Sacco enclosed in a magazine, begging him to let his
lawyer see it. “<i>I hereby confess to being in the South Braintree
Shoe Company crime and Sacco and Vanzetti were not in said
crime.</i>—<span class='sc'>Celestino F. Madeiros</span>”.</p>

<p class='c010'>Here is Madeiros’s own account of the crime:</p>

<p class='c011'>On April 15, 1920, I was picked up about 4 A. M. at my
boarding house, 181 North Main St., Providence, by four Italians
who came in a Hudson five-passenger open touring car.
My sister’s landlord lived at the same place. She was then a
widow and her name was Mary Bover. She has since been
married, and now lives at 735 Bellville Avenue, New Bedford.
There was also living there at the same time a man named Arthur
Tatro, who afterwards committed suicide in the house of Correction
of New Bedford. He was Captain and I was Lieutenant in
the American Rescue League at that time. Two or three privates
in the league also lived there, whose names I do not remember.</p>

<p class='c011'>We went from Providence to Randolph, where we changed
to a Buick car brought there by another Italian. We left the
Hudson car in the woods and took it again after we did the job,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>leaving the Buick in the woods in charge of one man, who drove
it off to another part of the woods, as I understood.</p>

<p class='c011'>After we did the job at South Braintree and changed back
into the Hudson car at Randolph, we drove very fast through
Randolph, and were seen by a boy named Thomas and his sister.
His father lives on a street that I think is called Prang Street,
and is in the window metal business or something of that kind.
I became acquainted with him four years later when I went to
live in Randolph with Weeks on the same street. Thomas told
me one day in conversation that he saw the car that did the
South Braintree job going through Randolph very fast.</p>

<p class='c011'>When we started we went from Providence first to Boston
and then back to Providence, and then back to South Braintree,
getting there about noon. We spent some time in a “speak
easy” in South Braintree two or three miles from the place of
the crime, leaving the car in the yard of the house.</p>

<p class='c011'>When we went to Boston we went to South Boston and
stopped in Andrews Square. I stayed in the car. The others
went in a saloon to get information, as they told me, about the
money that was to be sent to South Braintree.</p>

<p class='c011'>I had never been to South Braintree before. These four
men persuaded me to go with them two or three nights before
when I was talking with them in a saloon in Providence. The
saloon was also a poolroom, near my boarding house. They talked
like professionals. They said they had done lots of jobs of this
kind. They had been engaged in robbing freight cars in Providence.
Two were young men from 20 to 25 years old, one was
about 40, the other about 35. All wore caps. I then was 18
years old. I do not remember whether they were shaved or not.
Two of them did the shooting—the oldest one and another. They
were left on the street. The arrangement was that they should
meet me in a Providence saloon the next night to divide the
money. I went there but they did not come.</p>

<p class='c011'>I sat on the back seat of the automobile. I had a Colt 38
calibre automatic but did not use it. I was told that I was
there to help hold back the crowd in case they made a rush.
The curtains on the car were flapping. I do not remember
whether there was any shotgun or rifle in the car or not.</p>

<p class='c011'>These men talked a lot of New York. As soon as I got
enough money I went to New York and also Chicago hoping to
find them in cabarets spending the money, but I never found
them.</p>

<p class='c011'>They had been stealing silk, shoes, cotton, etc., from freight
cars sending it to New York. Two of them lived on South Main
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>Street and two on North Main Street, in lodging houses. I
had known them three months or four.</p>

<p class='c011'>The old man was called Mike. Another one was called
William or Bill. I don’t remember what the others were called.</p>

<p class='c011'>The money that they took from the men in South Braintree
was in a black bag, I think.</p>

<p class='c011'>I was scared to death when I heard the shooting begin.</p>

<p class='c011'>Both cars had Massachusetts numbers.</p>

<p class='c011'>The names of these men don’t amount to anything. They
change them whenever they want to. When they are driven
out of New York they come to Providence. I haven’t any idea
where they are now. I have never seen any of them since.</p>

<p class='c011'>Sacco and Vanzetti had nothing to do with this job, and
neither did Gerald Chapman. It was entirely put up by the
oldest of the Italians in Providence.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then there are the corroborating stories of Weeks, Madeiros’
associate now a lifer in the Charlestown Penitentiary, of the
owners of the Blue Bird Inn, of various Providence lawyers and
policemen as to the activities of the Morelli gang.</p>

<p class='c007'>Out of this comparatively understandable world of thieves
and murderers, the affidavits lead us into the underground
passages of the Department of Justice, into a world of dicks
and stoolpigeons.</p>

<p class='c007'>Here are the three main affidavits. They speak for
themselves.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>AFFIDAVIT OF LAWRENCE LETHERMAN</h3>

<p class='c013'>My name is Lawrence Letherman. I live in Malden, and
am in the employ of the Beacon Trust Company. I was in the
Federal service for thirty-six years, first in the railway mail
service for nine years; then as Post Office Inspector for twenty
five years; then three years as local agent of the Department of
Justice in Boston in charge of the Bureau of Investigation. I
began the last named duties in September, 1921.</p>

<p class='c011'>While I was Post Office Inspector I co-operated to a
considerable extent with the agents of the Department of Justice
in Boston in matters of joint concern, including the Sacco-Vanzetti
case. The man under me in direct charge of matters relating
to that case was Mr. William West, who is still attached to the
Department of Justice in Boston. I know that Mr. West
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>co-operated with Mr. Katzmann, the District Attorney, during
the trial of the case, and later with Mr. Williams. I know
that before, during, and after the trial of Sacco and Vanzetti
Mr. West had a number of so-called “under cover” men assigned
to this case, including one Ruzzamenti and one Carbone. I know
that by an arrangement with the Department of Justice, Carbone
was placed in a cell next to the cell of Sacco for the purpose of
obtaining whatever incriminating information he could obtain
from Sacco, after winning his confidence. Nothing, however, was
obtained in that way. One Weiss, formerly an agent of the
Department, was involved in this plan. He was running a
private office at that time on the seventh floor of the building
at 7 Water Street under the offices of the Department, and
remained in touch with the Department agents. Efforts were
made by Mr. West to put other men in the Dedham Jail as
spies, but the men whom he desired to use for that purpose
objected.</p>

<p class='c011'>Before, during, and after the trial, the Department of
Justice had a number of men assigned to watch the activities of
the Sacco-Vanzetti Defense Committee. No evidence warranting
prosecution of anybody was obtained by these men. They were
all “under cover” men, and one or two of them obtained
employment by the Committee in some capacity or other. I
think one of them was a collector. The Department of Justice
in Boston was anxious to get sufficient evidence against Sacco
and Vanzetti to deport them, but never succeeded in getting the
kind and amount of evidence required for that purpose. It was
the opinion of the Department agents here that a conviction
of Sacco and Vanzetti for murder would be one way of disposing
of these two men. It was also the general opinion of such agents
in Boston as had any actual knowledge of the Sacco-Vanzetti
case; that Sacco and Vanzetti, although anarchists and agitators,
were not highway robbers, and had nothing to do with the South
Braintree crime. My opinion, and the opinion of most of the
older men in the Government service, has always been that the
South Braintree crime was the work of professionals.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Boston agents of the Department of Justice assigned
certain men to attend the trial of Sacco and Vanzetti, including
Mr. Weyand. Mr. West also attended the trial. There is or
was a great deal of correspondence on file in the Boston office
between Mr. West and Mr. Katzmann, the District Attorney, and
there are also copies of reports sent to Washington about the
case. Letters and reports were made in triplicate; two copies
were sent to Washington and one retained in Boston. The
letters and documents on file in the Boston office would throw a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>great deal of light upon the preparation of the Sacco-Vanzetti
case for trial, and upon the real opinion of the Boston office of
the Department of Justice as to the guilt of Sacco and Vanzetti
of the particular crime with which they were charged.</p>

<p class='c011'>I know that at one time Mr. West placed an Italian printer
or linotyper in the office of some Italian newspaper in Boston
for the purpose of obtaining information. One of the men
employed by West at one stage of the Sacco-Vanzetti case was
named Shaughnessy. He was subsequently convicted of highway
robbery and is now serving a term in the Massachusetts State
Prison. One of the “under cover” men employed by Mr. West
was an Armenian named Harold Zorian. While being paid $7.00
a day by the Government he became Secretary of some Communist
or Radical organization in the vicinity of Boston, the
proceedings of which he reported to the Department.</p>

<p class='c007'>(So the government <i>was</i> interested in the conviction of Sacco
and Vanzetti? Provocative agents <i>were</i> used to gain the confidence
of the Defense Committee? The Department of Justice <i>is</i> in
possession of evidence and information about the case?</p>

<p class='c007'>“Have Attorney General Sargent and his subordinates&#160;...
stooped so low and are they so degraded that they are willing
by the concealment of evidence to enter into a fraudulent
conspiracy with the government of Massachusetts to send two
men to the electric chair, not because they were murderers but
because they were radicals?” asks Judge Thayer in his decision).</p>

<h3 class='c012'>AFFIDAVIT OF FRED J. WEYAND</h3>

<p class='c013'>My name is Fred J. Weyand. I reside in Portland, Maine.
I am a Special Agent of the Attorney General’s office of the State
of Maine, and have been since I resigned as an agent of the
Department of Justice about a year and a half ago.</p>

<p class='c011'>I became connected with the Department of Justice in the
year 1916, and shortly afterwards became a Special Agent with
an office first at 24 Milk Street, Boston, later at 45 Milk Street
and later at 7 Water Street, where the Department had offices
on the eighth floor, and later at the Post Office Building. My
duties as Special Agent were in general to investigate and report
upon any and all violations of the penal code which I might be
assigned to investigate by my superiors, who were first Frederick
Smith, next George E. Kelliher, next John Hannahan, next
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>Charles Bancroft and last Lawrence Letherman. These were
my superiors while I was working from the Boston office. I
occasionally worked in other parts of the country and then came
under other superiors temporarily. I was a Special Agent during
the entire administration of Mitchell Palmer, Attorney General
of the United States, and was concerned in the activities against
the so-called Reds or Radicals, including arrests and deportations
which were instigated by Mr. Palmer, and which included the
wholesale raids made in the month of January 1920, in some of
which I participated.</p>

<p class='c011'>Sometime before the arrest of Sacco and Vanzetti on
May 5, 1920—just how long before I do not remember—the
names of both of them had got in the files of the Department
of Justice as Radicals to be watched. The Boston files of the
Department, including correspondence, would show the date when
the names of these men were first brought to the attention of
the Department. Both these men were listed as followers or
associates of an educated Italian editor named Galleani. Galleani
was the publisher of an anarchistic paper. He lived in Wrentham
and published his paper, I think, in Lynn. Among other persons
associated with Galleani were Carlo Tresca, Carlo Valdinoci and
David Tedesco. The suspicion entertained by the Department
of Justice against Sacco and Vanzetti was that they had violated
the Selective Service Act, and also that they were anarchists or
held Radical opinions of some sort or other.</p>

<p class='c011'>A man named Feri Felix Weiss was transferred from the
Immigration Bureau to the Department of Justice in Boston in
the year 1917, and remained a Special Agent of that Department
in Boston until 1919, I think. He then travelled abroad and
returned in 1920 and opened an office as a scientific detective
and lecturer at 7 Water Street, Boston, with an office on the
floor below occupied by the Department of Justice. In 1925,
Weiss returned to the Immigration Department at Boston, where
he is at the present time.</p>

<p class='c011'>William J. West, who is now a Special Agent of the Department
of Justice, became such in July or August 1917. Prior to
that he was an Immigration Inspector with Feri Weiss. Since
his appointment as a Special Agent he has spent most of his
time in the Boston office of the Department of Justice, having in
charge during the past seven years the so-called Radical Division
of the Department of Justice, which has been in operation since
about 1917.</p>

<p class='c011'>During the year 1920 I did a good deal of work in the State
of Maine, but was in Boston for several days at least once every
two weeks. I have knowledge that the result of the trial before
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>Judge Anderson of the Radicals or Communists, as we called
them, arrested at the time of the raids above referred to, and
of the decision of Judge Anderson freeing many of them and of
his criticisms of the Department of Justice, was to make all
agents of the Department of Justice in Boston more cautious
afterwards in proceeding against suspected Radicals.</p>

<p class='c011'>Shortly after the arrest of Sacco and Vanzetti on the charge
of the South Braintree murders, meetings began to be held
by sympathizers, and I was assigned to attend these meetings
and report to the Department the speeches made. We also
assigned a certain “under cover” man, as we called him, to win
the confidence of the Sacco-Vanzetti Defense Committee, and
to become one of the collectors. This man used to report the
proceedings of the Committee to the Department agents in
Boston, and has said to me he was in the habit of taking as
much money collected for his own use as he saw fit. So far as
I know, no evidence was obtained of utterances at any of these
meetings which warranted proceedings against anybody. Mr.
West was also attending meetings of Sacco-Vanzetti sympathizers
during the same period. The original reports thus obtained
were sent to the Washington office of the Department of Justice
and duplicates kept in the Boston office, where I believe they now
are. I know that at one time as many as twelve agents of the
Department of Justice located in Boston were assigned to cover
Sacco-Vanzetti meetings and other Radical activities connected
with the Sacco-Vanzetti case. No evidence was discovered
warranting the institution of proceedings against anybody. I
have no present recollection of the trial of Vanzetti for the
alleged Bridgewater robbery; but when the joint trial of Sacco
and Vanzetti for the South Braintree murders began in the
summer of 1921, the Department of Justice at Boston took an
active interest in the matter. I was assigned to cover the trial
for the purpose of reporting the proceedings and picking up any
information that I could in regard to the Radical activities of
Sacco and Vanzetti, or of any of their friends. Mr. West also
attended the trial for the same purpose. I was not personally
in touch with Mr. Katzmann, the District Attorney, or his office,
but Mr. West was in touch with them and was giving and
obtaining information in regard to the case.</p>

<p class='c011'>Going back now before the trial, a certain John Ruzzamenti
had been informally employed by special agents of the Department
of Justice from some time in the year 1917, to furnish information
concerning Radical activities and evasion of the draft by
Italians, and in this connection had made an investigation of
Tedesco, above referred to, who was once arrested in consequence
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>of information furnished by Ruzzamenti, but was never tried.
During this time Ruzzamenti also worked occasionally for
detective agencies. He was well known to Weiss.</p>

<p class='c011'>I have been informed by Mr. West and believe, and therefore
allege, that there was another Italian whom the Department
occasionally used for similar purposes, named Carbone and that
he, under an arrangement with the District Attorney, the Sheriff,
and Mr. Weiss, was placed in the cell next to the cell of Sacco
sometime during the year 1920 for the purpose of winning the
confidence of Sacco, and thus of obtaining, if he could, incriminating
evidence against him, but no evidence of the sort was
obtained by Carbone. The primary purpose of the Department
in putting Carbone there was to obtain evidence, if possible,
concerning the so-called Wall Street explosion; but it was also
hoped that other incriminating evidence might be obtained.</p>

<p class='c011'>Sometime in the early part of the year 1921, I was informed
by Ruzzamenti that he had been sent for by Weiss, who was
then out of Government service, to come on here to help convict
Sacco and Vanzetti; that he had seen Katzmann, and that an
arrangement had been made by which he was to secure board
in the house of Mrs. Sacco and obtain her confidence, and thus
obtain information; but that arrangement had never been
carried out, and he had not been paid. I annex to this affidavit
photostatic copies of parts of a letter which I identify as in the
handwriting of Weiss.</p>

<p class='c011'>Shortly after the trial of Sacco and Vanzetti was concluded
I said to Weiss that I did not believe they were the right men,
meaning the men who shot the paymaster, and he replied that
that might be so, but that they were bad actors and would get
what they deserved anyway.</p>

<p class='c011'>Instructions were received from the Chief of the Bureau of
the Department of Justice in Washington from time to time in
reference to the Sacco-Vanzetti case. They are on file or should
be on file in the Boston office.</p>

<p class='c011'>The understanding in this case between the agents of the
Department of Justice in Boston and the District Attorney
followed the usual custom, that the Department of Justice would
help the District Attorney to secure a conviction, and that he in
turn would help the agents of the Department of Justice to
secure information that they might desire. This would include
the turning over of any pertinent information by the Department
of Justice to the District Attorney. Sacco and Vanzetti were,
at least in the opinion of the Boston agents of the Department of
Justice, not liable to deportation as draft dodgers, but only as
anarchists, and could not be deported as anarchists unless it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>could be shown that they were believers in anarchy, which is
always a difficult thing to show. It usually can only be shown
by self-incrimination. The Boston agents believed that these
men were anarchists, and hoped to be able to secure the necessary
evidence against them from their testimony at their trial for
murder, to be used in case they were not convicted for murder.
There is correspondence between Mr. Katzmann and Mr. West
on file in the Boston office of the Department. Mr. West
furnished Mr. Katzmann information about the Radical activities
of Sacco and Vanzetti to be used in their cross-examination.</p>

<p class='c011'>In the years 1922–1924 Mr. West had working for him as
“under cover” or secret operators an Italian and a Syrian or
Armenian. The Italian worked as a printer. I do not remember
the names of either of them; but I know that he put the Italian
in as a linotyper in the office of an Italian newspaper in Boston
as a spy. The Syrian or Armenian is the man to whom I have
referred above as having become a collector for the Committee.</p>

<p class='c011'>From my investigation, combined with the investigation
made by the other agents of the Department in Boston, I am
convinced not only that these men had violated the Selective
Service rules and regulations and evaded the draft, but that they
were anarchists, and that they ought to have been deported. By
calling these men anarchists, I do not mean necessarily that they
were inclined to violence, nor do I understand all the different
meanings that different people would attach to the word
“anarchists”. What I mean is that I think they did not believe
in organized government or in private property. But I am also
thoroughly convinced and always have been, and I believe that
is and always has been the opinion of such Boston agents of the
Department of Justice as had any knowledge on the subject, that
these men had nothing whatever to do with the South Braintree
murders, and that their conviction was the result of co-operation
between the Boston agents of the Department of Justice and the
District Attorney. It was the general opinion of the Boston
agents of the Department of Justice having knowledge of the
affair that the South Braintree crime was committed by a gang
of professional highwaymen.</p>

<p class='c011'>I annex hereto a picture of Mr. Feri Felix Weiss printed
on the outside of one of his advertisements.</p>

<p class='c007'>So ends as fine a picture of the inner workings of the Spanish
Inquisition as has seen the light in many a day. I can’t help
quoting again Judge Thayer’s very pertinent question:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Have Attorney General Sargent and his subordinates&#160;...
stooped so low and are they so degraded that they are willing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>by the concealment of evidence to enter into a fraudulent
conspiracy with the government of Massachusetts to send two
men to the electric chair, not because they were murderers but
because they were radicals?”</p>

<h3 class='c012'>AFFIDAVIT OF JOHN RUZZAMENTI</h3>

<p class='c013'>John Ruzzamenti being first duly sworn, on oath deposes
and says that he is now and has been for upwards of thirty days
last past a resident of the City of Boston, County of Suffolk and
Commonwealth of Massachusetts.</p>

<p class='c011'>That in the month of December 1920 the affiant resided
in the town of Reddington, State of Pennsylvania, and was
employed in the capacity of brass melter in the Reddington
Standard Fitting Corporation, a subsidiary of the Bethlehem
Steel Corporation.</p>

<p class='c011'>That sometime in December 1920 and to the affiant’s best
knowledge, information and belief, about December 18th or 19th,
he, the affiant, received through the United States Post Office
an envelope bearing Boston post-mark and stamped with special
delivery stamp and containing the name and address of affiant.
That inside of said envelope was another sealed envelope bearing
on the outside the notation “burn this after you have read”.
That inside of said sealed envelope was a letter purporting to
come from one Feri Felix Weiss. That affiant well knew said
Weiss having worked with and been employed by said Weiss when
said Weiss was employed by the United States Department of
Justice at Boston specially assigned to so-called Red or Radical
cases. That the affiant then had in his possession a card of
said Weiss reading as follows, to-wit:</p>

      <div class='line'>My dear John:</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Just returned from a trip I found your two letters,
and answer them by return mail.</p>

<p class='c011'>Would you like to help me on a case which I may
clinch here? It is the case of Sacco and Vanzetti, who
are in jail awaiting trial for having shot the paymaster
of the South Braintree shoefactory.</p>

<p class='c011'>Do you know these fellows? They are members of
the Galleani gang, and Sacco used to work in the
Cordage works in Plymouth.</p>

<p class='c011'>He also worked in the Plant shoe factory.</p>

<p class='c011'>It is a very important case, and I need a clever
Italian who would mix with the gang, and if necessary
even stay in jail for a few days just to find out what
they say.</p>

<p class='c011'>How much pay would you want?</p>

<p class='c011'>You would have to come right away.</p>

<p class='c011'>Do you think you could work amongst them?</p>

<p class='c011'>I am not sure whether they might know you from
Milford, though I don’t think that Sacco was ever there.</p>

<p class='c011'>If we are successful in this venture, we might tackle
the big Wall Street affair in New York, as all the other
agencies are up against a wall in that matter.</p>

<p class='c011'>Let me know by the return envelope which I
herewith enclose.</p>

<p class='c011'>I must give my friends an answer not later than
Monday, so you must mail your answer to me immediately.
Don’t write me a long letter, just say “yes, I’ll
work for $8” a day, or whatever you want, so I can
put it up to my friend.</p>

<p class='c011'>In case you get my letter only Sunday, better
telegraph me your answer, P. O. Box 2107. Just say
“Yes, $8” “John”.</p>

<p class='c011'>I am afraid they won’t pay $8, so make it less if
you can.</p>

<p class='c011'>Of course any expenses would be extra.</p>

<p class='c011'>If we deliver the goods they will probably give
us the reward.</p>

<p class='c011'>I think there is $2,000 written out.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>You would have to start as soon as possible,
probably after Christmas, if you care to stay with your
folks over the holidays.</p>

<p class='c007'>That immediately upon receipt of said letter the affiant well
knowing from past experience with said Weiss the need of
expedition and secrecy, instructed his wife, Laura Ruzzamenti, to
telegraph to said Feri Felix Weiss, P. O. Box 2107, Boston Mass.
in substance and effect that he, the affiant would come to Boston
immediately after the Christmas holidays, and said telegram as
outlined above was sent.</p>

<p class='c007'>That between the said date of sending of said telegram to
said Feri Felix Weiss and the morning of December 27th, 1920
when the affiant secured leave of absence from said Reddington
Standard Fitting Corporation, and left Reddington, Pennsylvania
to come to the City of Boston, no letter or telegram or communication
of any character was received by the affiant from the
said Feri Felix Weiss.</p>

<p class='c007'>That upon arrival in the City of Boston, Commonwealth of
Massachusetts, on the evening of December 27th, 1920, at or
about the hour of ten p. m., the affiant went to the office of said
Feri Felix Weiss at 7 Water Street in the City of Boston and
made inquiry for said Weiss, but found that he was out for the
evening. Whereupon the affiant went to the American House
in said City of Boston and there registered.</p>

<p class='c007'>That following morning, December 28th, 1920, the affiant
went to the office of said Feri Felix Weiss at 7 Water Street
in said City of Boston and interviewed the said Weiss.</p>

<p class='c007'>That the said Weiss then admitted receipt of affiant’s
telegram but expressed some surprise that the affiant had come
to the City of Boston in view of the fact that the said Weiss
had sent to him, the affiant, a telegram stating that he should
not come.</p>

<p class='c007'>That the affiant has since made inquiry and to the best of
his knowledge, information and belief the said Weiss did not
send a telegram to the affiant, but did send a letter stating in
effect that he, the affiant, was not to come to Boston until further
word was received from the said Weiss, but that said letter was
not received in Reddington, Pennsylvania, until December 28th,
1920, the day after the affiant left Reddington, Pennsylvania.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>That after some discussion the said Weiss stated to the
affiant in substance and effect that however it was all right:
that he, the affiant, was here in Boston and that he, the said Weiss,
would immediately get in touch with Mr. Frederick G. Katzmann,
the District Attorney for Norfolk and Plymouth Counties,
Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and would arrange for an
interview between the said Katzmann and the affiant.</p>

<p class='c007'>That the said Weiss in the presence of affiant attempted
to telephone the said Frederick G. Katzmann, but was unable
at that time to secure a connection at the office of said Katzmann
at Hyde Park, Commonwealth of Massachusetts.</p>

<p class='c007'>That thereafter, to-wit, December 28th and December 29th
1920, the affiant remained in and about the office of said Weiss
discussing with said Weiss and receiving from said Weiss the
details of the plan purporting to be the product of the minds
of said Weiss and said Katzmann and mutually agreed upon
between said Weiss and said Katzmann, the details of which plan
are hereinafter set forth, and also awaiting instructions from
said Weiss as to when he, the affiant, should see the said
Katzmann; that sometime in the afternoon of December 29th,
1920 the affiant received instructions from said Weiss to be at
the office of said Katzmann at said Hyde Park the morning of
December 30th, 1920 at nine a. m.</p>

<p class='c007'>That in accordance with said instructions the affiant at nine
a. m. on December 30th, 1920 was at the office of said Frederick
G. Katzmann, District Attorney of Norfolk and Plymouth
Counties, Commonwealth of Massachusetts, at Hyde Park,
Massachusetts, and there awaited the coming of said Katzmann,
that shortly after nine a. m. the affiant saw a gentleman enter
the said building and go upstairs; that thereupon the affiant
followed the said party and saw him turn to the door marked
with the name of said Katzmann and insert a key; that the
affiant then stepped up to said party, whereupon the said party
turned and said to him, the affiant, “Is that you John?”
whereupon the affiant admitted his identity and was welcomed
into the office by said Katzmann, the said Katzmann helping the
affiant to remove his overcoat; that the affiant then explained
to said Katzmann that he had been sent there by said Weiss
and presented as evidence of his identity the card of said Weiss
with the name of the affiant written in the handwriting of said
Weiss on the back of said card.</p>

<p class='c007'>That immediately after the identity of the affiant was
established to the satisfaction of said Katzmann, the said
Katzmann asked the affiant in substance and effect what he had to
say of importance; whereupon the affiant outlined to the said
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>Katzmann the proposition, or plan that had been proposed to the
affiant by said Weiss, and which the affiant had been told was
the product of the minds of Weiss and said Katzmann, which
was in substance and effect that he, the affiant, was by
prearranged plan and in concert with police officers to break
and enter some dwelling house for the ostensible purpose of
committing the crime of burglary, and that by prearranged plan
with said police officers the affiant was to be apparently caught
in the act of committing the crime of burglary; that then the
affiant would be duly and regularly arrested, complaint issued,
committment papers executed and the affiant confined under the
terms of said committment in the Dedham County Jail in Norfolk
County, Commonwealth of Massachusetts, the said jail being the
jail where Nicola Sacco, named in the title herein, was then
confined and awaiting trial on the charge of murder.</p>

<p class='c007'>That then by prearranged plan and in concert and with the
understanding of one Samuel Capen, High Sheriff of Norfolk
County, Commonwealth of Massachusetts, the affiant would be
placed in a cell next to and adjoining to the one occupied by
said Sacco, and that the affiant would then, by preconceived plan
and by special arrangement with said High Sheriff of Norfolk
County, be given special privileges and special opportunity to
establish the confidence of and to act as a stool pigeon on said
Nicola Sacco. That in this connection the said Weiss had
instructed the affiant that he, the affiant, was upon his incarceration
to appear to be very much depressed and melancholy
by reason of his arrest and was to make no attempt to talk with
said Sacco for at least three days after his arrest. That the affiant
outlining the said plan to the said Katzmann as same had
been outlined to the affiant by said Weiss, stated to the said
Katzmann that he, the affiant, had never been arrested and was
not agreeable to this plan of arrest; that while he, the affiant,
had been previously engaged by the said Weiss as an operative
while the said Weiss was in the United States Department of
Justice, nevertheless the affiant had never up to that time ever
gone so far as to commit a crime in the furtherance of any end,
and that he, the affiant, could not and would not agree to the
said plan of said Weiss, but was willing to listen to any counter
suggestion or other proposition that might be made by the said
Katzmann.</p>

<p class='c007'>That thereupon the said Katzmann said to the affiant in substance
and effect that he, the said Katzmann, was right hard up
against it; that he, the said Katzmann, had no evidence as
against the said Nicola Sacco or as against the said Bartolomeo
Vanzetti, that they, the said Sacco and said Vanzetti, had not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>talked and would not talk; that he had been unable to get anything
out of them or out of any other person, that said
Katzmann named in this connection some man that he had
arrested in connection with a motorcycle, and stated that
he had grilled this man but had been unable to learn anything,
and that it was necessary that he secure other and additional
testimony to that which he already had. Whereupon with this
preliminary explanation, the said Katzmann made the following
proposition, to-wit:</p>

<p class='c007'>That Rosina Sacco or Rose Sacco, the wife of said Nicola
Sacco, resided in the town of Stoughton, Commonwealth of
Massachusetts and there had a small home and had an extra and
unused room in said house by reason of the arrest and incarceration
of her husband, and he, the said Katzmann, then
proposed to the affiant that he, the affiant, should undertake to
secure employment in said town of Stoughton or some place
adjacent thereto and should as an Italian and a member of the
same race as the said Rosina or Rose Sacco, secure a room in her
home, and that for and by reason of the fact that the said Rosina
or Rose Sacco was undergoing great physical, mental and
spiritual suffering by reason of the incarceration of her husband,
it should be easy for the affiant to establish friendly relations
with her, and said relations once established, it would then be
easy for the affiant to secure confidential communications from
her as to any criminal activities of her husband, the said Nicola
Sacco. That the affiant agreed to undertake this plan.</p>

<p class='c007'>That thereupon the said Katzmann stated to the affiant that
it would be some few days before he, the said Katzmann, was
ready to go ahead, that meanwhile he, the affiant, was to “send
me” (Katzmann) “your expense bill and I will see that it goes
through the County and you will get your money.” That the
affiant then left the said Katzmann’s office, the said Katzmann
courteously helping the affiant to put on his overcoat and following
him to the door and shaking hands in parting.</p>

<p class='c007'>That the affiant then returned to Boston and reported to
said Feri Felix Weiss. That the day following the affiant sent his
statement to said Katzmann. That meanwhile it was arranged
between the affiant and said Weiss that he, the affiant, would be
employed by said Weiss pending word from said Katzmann on
a job down on Cape Cod; that thereupon he, the affiant, went to
Cape Cod on said investigation for said Weiss and was employed
for a period of approximately two weeks; that nothing developing
and the affiant receiving no word from said Weiss, he, the
affiant, returned to Pennsylvania sometime about the middle of
January 1921.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>That after the affiant returned to Pennsylvania he received
a letter from said Weiss, only a part of said letter being now
in the possession of the affiant; the part which he now has
reading on the face thereof as follows, to-wit:</p>

<div class='lg-container-l c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Dear John:</div>

it to you.”</p>

<p class='c015'>and on the back thereof as follows, to-wit:</p>

<p class='c016'>“was a big trial of Mrs. De Falco. I’ll remind him by

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>That after a number of letters written by the affiant to the
said Weiss and to the said Katzmann, the affiant received
another letter from said Weiss reading as follows, to-wit:</p>

<div class='lg-container-l c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“My dear John:</div>

<p class='c011'>I got your letters about collecting money from

<p class='c011'>As much as I regret that you have such a hard
time with your children being out of work, I am not
blind to facts, and feel I must enlighten you.</p>

<p class='c011'>First of all you must remember that you came here
of your own will. Nobody told you to come to Boston.
I telegraphed clearly that you should only come when
I write you. You did not wait for my letter. I then
did the next best thing for you, and employed you on

<p class='c011'>Then Katzmann said he might pay you. So put in
your bill, as promised, but have not heard from him.
It will be a good thing if you write to him personally
about it; he probably will hurry it along.</p>

<p class='c011'>But remember, that you can force neither him nor
me to pay your expenses, as there was absolutely no
agreement to that effect between him, me and you. Keep
this clearly in your mind.</p>

<p class='c011'>It is foolish to send your wife here, as that only
makes additional expense, without any result. A letter
to Katzmann will do just as well.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>If I was fixed better financially, I would gladly send
you the money, as I regarded you always as my friend,
and am always sorry for anybody with a large family
to support at the present time. But I have a hard
pull myself.</p>

<p class='c011'>That is all I can say today. Hoping to hear from
Katzmann soon, or that you hear from him if you write,
believe me,</p>

<p class='c007'>That the wife of the affiant, Laura Ruzzamenti, sometime
in the spring of 1921, to-wit in the month of April, called on
the said Katzmann and presented the claim of her husband and
asked that same be paid.</p>

<p class='c007'>That said claim for transportation, time and expenses has
not been paid by said Katzmann or said Weiss or by any person
notwithstanding the fact that the affiant has made many and
divers efforts to secure said pay, same consisting of the sending
of the statement of transportation, time and expenses in
accordance with request of said Katzmann on the day following
the interview of December 30th, 1920; and the sending of a
great number of letters written by the affiant to the said
Katzmann. That said statement has not been paid and said
letters have not been answered.</p>

<p class='c007'>(In this connection we must insert the letter of Feri Felix
Weiss that did not come into Mr. Thompson’s hands until several
weeks after the hearing. Here are his affidavit and Weiss’s
letter that completes the picture.)</p>

<h3 class='c012'>AFFIDAVIT OF WILLIAM G. THOMPSON</h3>

<p class='c013'>My name is William G. Thompson. I am counsel for the
defendants in the above entitled case. On or about Sept. 21
last I learned from Mr. Frank P. Sibley, a reporter on the <cite>Boston
Globe</cite>, that that newspaper had just received a letter from Feri
Felix Weiss, with a request that it be published, but that the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>Globe did not intend to publish the letter. Shortly afterward
I began efforts to obtain this letter, and succeeded in doing so
today, Oct. 7, with it was the envelope in which it was received
at the Globe office. I annex said original letter and said envelope
hereto, and make them part of this affidavit.</p>

<p class='c011'>As I remember it, there is a fac-simile of the signature of
Weiss on the picture of him annexed to the affidavit of Fred J.
Weyand. I also call attention to the fact that this letter is
written upon a letterhead stamped with the name of said Weiss,
and was received in an envelope also stamped with his name in
the upper left hand corner.</p>

<p class='c011'>In connection with this letter I call attention to the contents
of the letter of said Weiss to John Ruzzamenti on file in the case,
a fac-simile of a part of which is also annexed to the affidavit of
said Weyand, and of the following statements therein—namely,
letter dated Dec. 17, 1920:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Would you like to help me on a case which I may
clinch here? It is the case of Sacco and Vanzetti, who
are in jail awaiting trial for having shot the paymaster
of the South Braintree shoe factory.&#160;*&#160;*&#160;* It is a very
important case, and I need a clever Italian who would
mix with the gang, and, if necessary, even stay in jail
for a few days just to find out what they say.&#160;*&#160;*&#160;* I
am afraid they won’t pay $8, so make it less if you can.
Of course any expenses would be extra. If we deliver
the goods they will probably give us the reward. I
think there is $2,000 written out.”</p>

<p class='c007'>In connection with this letter I also call attention to the
parts of the affidavits of Weyand and Letherman relating to the
activities and purposes of said Weiss in connection with the
prosecution of Sacco and Vanzetti. I also, in connection with
this letter, call attention to the affidavit of Mr. Katzmann on file
in this case. I especially desire to call attention to the following
sentences in this letter, namely:</p>

<p class='c011'>“I explained to him (Katzmann) that anarchists
do not commit crimes for money, but for a principle,
and that banditry was not in their code”, and</p>

<p class='c011'>“The truth in the “framing” was that we intended
to put Ruzzamenti in with Sacco as much to clear Sacco
of any guilt in the Braintree affair as to find him
guilty.”</p>

    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Dear Sir:—</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>It has just come to my attention—stationed as I am in the
Government service in the West—that my name has been
mentioned in your account of the “Sacco and Vanzetti” affair
through an affidavit by former District Attorney Katzmann on
one hand, and the connection of Ruzzamenti on the other.</p>

<p class='c011'>The facts, as far as I am concerned with this case, are as
follows:</p>

<p class='c011'>Katzmann sent for me at the time to learn what I knew
about Sacco, having been Special Agent of the United States
Department of Justice in charge of investigations covering
anarchists and similar criminals whose aim was the forceful
overthrow of the Government of the United States. I told
Katzmann that I knew that Sacco was an active anarchist,
connected with the famous or notorious Galleani group of Lynn,
Mass., who had bomb-outrages on the brain. When Katzmann
asked me what I thought of Sacco as a participant in the Braintree
holdup, I explained to him that anarchists do not commit
crimes for money but for a principle, and that banditry was
not in their code.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was at the suggestion of Katzmann that I wrote the
undercover informant Ruzzamenti whether he was willing to go
to jail and share the cell with Sacco to find out what Sacco had
to tell about his connection with the Braintree affair. Ruzzamenti
did not answer this letter by a letter, but took the first
train from Pennsylvania to Boston. Though this was against
my arrangement with him, I faced the situation, and sent him
to Katzmann, who had agreed over the phone to talk to Ruzzamenti
regarding the plan we had in mind. Katzmann then
decided, after a talk with Ruzzamenti, that he better drop the
matter.</p>

<p class='c011'>Ruzzamenti tried to collect expenses from Katzmann, but
failed. Then Ruzzamenti turned around and sold out to the
defense. He used my letter to him as evidence. The first I
knew of Ruzzamenti’s treachery was when I received a warning
from a friendly source in Spain to the effect that my letter had
been broadcasted in mimeograph form to aid in the collection
of funds for the Sacco and Vanzetti defense. My friend sent
me warning lest the rabid Latin anarchists should take it into
their heads to “get square” with me for trying to “frame Sacco.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>The truth in the “framing” was that we intended to put
Ruzzamenti in with Sacco as much to clear Sacco of any guilt
in the Braintree affair as to find him guilty! I had no interest
whatsoever in railroading an innocent man to the electric chair,
and Lawyer Thompson’s reference to me as “being heartless” is
absurd, if not ridiculous. My entire connection with this case
was outlined here, and my only motive in trying to clear up the
mystery was to aid justice.</p>

<p class='c011'>That I should be abused and besmirched with mud by both
sides, the defense as well as the District Attorney, when I acted
as any patriotic citizen would to protect the life and property of
all, is a sad reflection upon legal ethics in Massachusetts. I
leave it to the public to pass judgment in view of the above
cited facts. That Katzmann is trying to wash his hands of the
Ruzzamenti fiasco, putting the blame on me; that Ruzzamenti
delivered my life into the hands of the international Reds the
world over by his treachery, reminds me of the two characters in
the New Testament who always seem to enjoy a resurrection:
Pontius Pilate and Judas Iscariot.</p>

<div class='lg-container-r c014'>

      <div class='line'>Respectfully,</div>
      <div class='line in16'><span class='sc'>Feri Felix Weiss</span></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>“<i>Have Attorney General Sargent and his subordinates&#160;...
stooped so low, and are they so degraded that they are willing
by the concealment of evidence to enter into a fraudulent
conspiracy with the government of Massachusetts to send two
men to the electric chair, not because they were murderers but
because they were radicals?</i>”</p>

<p class='c007'>(All attempts on the part of the defense to secure information
from the Department of Justice files on the case have so far
proved fruitless. Chief Counsel Thompson has written the
Attorney General of the United States on the subject and in
spite of the intercession of Senator Butler of Massachusetts,
received no satisfactory reply. The Department of Justice
refuses to give up its secrets.)</p>

<p class='c010'>Where are Sacco and Vanzetti in all this? A broken man
in Charlestown, a broken man in a grey birdcage in Dedham,
struggling to keep some shreds of human dignity in face of the
Chair? Not at all.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>Circumstances sometimes force men into situations so
dramatic, thrust their puny frames so far into the burning bright
searchlights of history that they or their shadows on men’s
minds become enormous symbols. Sacco and Vanzetti are all
the immigrants who have built this nation’s industries with
their sweat and their blood and have gotten for it nothing but
the smallest wage it was possible to give them and a helot’s
position under the bootheels of the Arrow Collar social order.
They are all the wops, hunkies, bohunks, factory fodder that
hunger drives into the American mills through the painful sieve
of Ellis Island. They are the dreams of a saner social order
of those who can’t stand the law of dawg eat dawg. This tiny
courtroom is a focus of the turmoil of an age of tradition, the
center of eyes all over the world. Sacco and Vanzetti throw
enormous shadows on the courthouse walls.</p>

<p class='c007'>William G. Thompson feels all this dimly when, the last
affidavit read, he pauses to begin his argument. But mostly
he feels that as a citizen it is his duty to protect the laws and
liberties of his state and as a man to try to save two innocent
men from being murdered by a machine set going in a
moment of hatred and panic. He is a broadshouldered man
with steely white hair and a broad forehead and broad cheek-bones.
He doesn’t mince words. He feels things intensely.
The case is no legal game of chess for him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I rest my case on these affidavits, on the other five
propositions that I have argued, but if they all fail, and I cannot
see how they can, I rest my case on that rock alone, on the sixth
proposition in my brief—innocent or guilty, right or wrong,
foolish or wise men—these men ought not now to be sentenced
to death for this crime so long as they have the right to say,
“The government of this great country put spies in my cell,
planned to put spies in my wife’s house, they put spies on my
friends, took money that they were collecting to defend me,
put it in their own pocket and joked about it and said they
don’t believe I am guilty but will help convict me, because they
could not get enough evidence to deport me under the laws of
Congress, and were willing as one of them continually said to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>adopt the method of killing me for murder as one way to get
rid of me.””</p>

<p class='c007'>Ranney’s handling of the case has been pretty perfunctory
throughout, he has contented himself with trying to destroy the
Court’s opinion of Madeiros’ veracity. A criminal is only to be
believed when he speaks to his own detriment. He presents
affidavits of the Morelli’s and their friends denying that they had
ever heard of Madeiros, tries to imply that Letherman and
Weyand were fired from the government employ and had no
right to betray the secrets of their department. He knows that
he does not need to make much effort. He is strong in the
inertia of the courts. The defence will have to exert six times
the energy of the prosecution to overturn the dead weighty
block of six other motions denied.</p>

<p class='c007'>Thompson comes back at him with a phrase worthy of
Patrick Henry.</p>

<p class='c007'>... “And I will say to your honor that a government that
has come to honor its own secrets more than the lives of its
citizens has become a tyranny whether you call it a republic or
monarchy or anything else.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Then the dry, crackling, careful voice of Judge Thayer and
the hearing is adjourned.</p>

<p class='c007'>Hear ye, hear ye, hear ye, all who have had business before
the honorable the justice of the superior court of the southeastern
district of Massachusetts will now disperse. The court
is adjourned without day.</p>

<p class='c007'>God Save the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Court refused to grant a new trial. The Court has
decided that Sacco and Vanzetti must die.</p>

<p class='c007'>God Save the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c006'>III<br> THE RED DELIRIUM</h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>How is all this possible? Why were these men ever
convicted in the first place? From the calm of the year of our
Lord 1926 it’s pretty hard to remember the delirious year 1920.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>On June 3rd 1919 a bomb exploded outside the Washington
house of Attorney General A. Mitchell Palmer. In the previous
months various people had received bombs through the mail,
one of them blowing off the two hands of the unfortunate housemaid
who undid the package. No one, and least of all the
federal detectives ever seems to have discovered who committed
these outrages or why they were committed. But their result
was to put a scare into every public official in the country, and
particularly into Attorney General Palmer. No one knew
where the lightning would strike next. The signing of peace
had left the carefully stirred up hatred of the war years
unsatisfied. It was easy for people who knew what they were
doing to turn the terrors of government officials and the
unanalyzed feeling of distrust of foreigners of the average man
into a great crusade of hate against reds, radicals, dissenters of
all sorts. The Department of Justice, backed by the press,
frenziedly acclaimed by the man on the street, invented an
immanent revolution. All the horrors of Russian Bolshevism
were about to be enacted on our peaceful shores. That fall
the roundup began. Every man had his ear to his neighbor’s
keyhole. This first crusade culminated in the sailing of the
Buford, the “soviet ark” loaded with alien “anarchists” and in
the preparation of the famous list of eighty thousand radicals who
were to be gotten out of the way.</p>

<p class='c007'>But that was not enough to satisfy the desire for victims
of the country at large, and the greed of the detectives and
anti-labor operatives of different sorts who were making a fat
living off the Department of Justice. So the January raids
were planned.</p>

<p class='c007'>The following paragraph from Louis F. Post’s book shows
that he, seeing the thing from the inside as Assistant Secretary
of Labor, felt that the hysteria was being pretty consciously
directed:</p>

<p class='c011'>“The whole red crusade seems to have been saturated with
‘labor spy’ interests—the interests, that is, of private detective
agencies which, in the secret service of masterful corporations,
were engaged in generating and intensifying industrial suspicions
and hatreds. It was under these influences, apparently,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>that the appropriations authorized by Congress “for the
detection and prosecution of crimes” exclusively, were in part
diverted to the rounding-up of aliens, not as criminals but as the
possible subjects for administrative deportation.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The January raids were aimed at the “Communists.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hardly had the year nineteen-twenty opened” says the
former Assistant Secretary of Labor, “when the Department of
Justice entered upon the red crusade for which its raiding of the
preceding November had been a tryout. Numerously recruited
for the occasion from roughneck groups of the strikebreaking
variety and actively supported by local police authorities, the
detective auxiliary of the Department of Justice spent the night
of the second day in January at raiding lawful assemblages in
more than thirty cities and towns of the United States—thirty-three
being the number officially reported. Their object was
wholesale arrests in furtherance of the plans already outlined
for mass deportations of alien members of the Communist and
the Communist-Labor parties. The approximate number of
arrests officially reported was 2,500.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The details can be read in the pamphlet on <i>Illegal Practices
of the Department of Justice</i> prepared in May of the same year
by a committee of twelve well-known lawyers.</p>

<p class='c007'>Here is the preface to that pamphlet:</p>

<div class='lg-container-l c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE:</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>For more than six months we, the undersigned lawyers,
whose sworn duty it is to uphold the Constitution and Laws of
the United States, have seen with growing apprehension the
continued violation of that Constitution and breaking of those
Laws by the Department of Justice of the United States government.</p>

<p class='c011'>Under the guise of a campaign for the suppression of radical
activities, the office of the Attorney General, acting by its local
agents throughout the country, and giving express instructions
from Washington, has committed continual illegal acts. Wholesale
arrests both of aliens and citizens have been made without
warrant or any process of law; men and women have been
jailed and held <i>incomunicado</i> without access of friends or counsel;
homes have been entered without search warrant and
property seized and removed; other property has been wantonly
destroyed; workingmen and workingwomen suspected of radical
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>views have been shamefully abused and maltreated. Agents
of the Department of Justice have been introduced into radical
organizations for the purpose of informing upon their members
or inciting them to activities; these agents have even been
instructed from Washington to arrange meetings upon certain
dates for the express object of facilitating wholesale raids and
arrests. In support of these illegal acts, and to create sentiment
in its favor, the Department of Justice has also constituted
itself a propaganda bureau, and has sent to newspapers and
magazines of this country quantities of material designed to
excite public opinion against radicals, all at the expense of the
government and outside the scope of the Attorney General’s
duties.</p>

<p class='c011'>We make no argument in favor of any radical doctrine as
such, whether Socialist, Communist or Anarchist. No one of
us belongs to any of these schools of thought. Nor do we now
raise any question as to the Constitutional protection of free
speech and a free press. We are concerned solely with bringing
to the attention of the American people the utterly illegal acts
which have been committed by those charged with the highest
duty of enforcing the laws—acts which have caused widespread
suffering and unrest, have struck at the foundation of American
free institutions, and have brought the name of our country into
disrepute.</p>

<p class='c011'>These acts may be grouped under the following heads:</p>

<h3 class='c019'>(1) <i>Cruel and Unusual Punishments</i>:</h3>

<p class='c013'>The Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution
provides:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Excessive bail shall not be required nor excessive
fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishments
inflicted.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Punishments of the utmost cruelty, and therefore unthinkable
in America, have become usual. Great numbers of persons
arrested, both aliens and citizens, have been threatened, beaten
with blackjacks, or actually tortured&#160;*&#160;*&#160;*</p>

<h3 class='c019'>(2) <i>Arrests without Warrant</i>:</h3>

<p class='c018'>The Fourth Amendment to the Constitution provides:</p>

<p class='c011'>“The right of the people to be secure in their
persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable
searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no
warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported
by oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the
place to be searched, and the persons or things to be
seized.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>Many hundreds of citizens and aliens alike have been
arrested in wholesale raids, without warrants or pretense of
warrants. They have then either been released, or have been
detained in police stations or jails for indefinite lengths of time
while warrants were being applied for. This practice of making
mass raids and mass arrests without warrant has resulted
directly from the instructions, both written and oral, issued by
the Department of Justice at Washington.</p>

<h3 class='c019'>(3) <i>Unreasonable Searches and Seizures</i>:</h3>

<p class='c018'>The Fourth Amendment has been quoted above.</p>

<p class='c007'>In countless cases agents of the Department of Justice have
entered the homes, offices, or gathering places of persons
suspected of radical affiliations, and, without pretense of any
search warrant, have seized and removed property belonging to
them for use by the Department of Justice. In many of these
raids property which could not be removed or was not useful to
the Department, was intentionally smashed and destroyed.</p>

<h3 class='c019'>(4) <i>Provocative Agents</i>:</h3>

<p class='c018'>We do not question the right of the Department of Justice
to use its agents in the Bureau of Investigation to ascertain
when the law is being violated. But the American people have
never tolerated the use of undercover provocative agents or
“agents provocateurs,” such as have been familiar in old Russia
or Spain. Such agents have been introduced by the Department
of Justice into the radical movements, have reached positions of
influence therein, have occupied themselves with informing
upon or instigating acts which might be declared criminal, and
at the express direction of Washington have brought about
meetings of radicals in order to make possible wholesale arrests
at such meetings.</p>

<h3 class='c019'>(5) <i>Compelling Persons to be Witnesses against Themselves</i>:</h3>

<p class='c018'>The Fifth Amendment provides as follows:</p>

<p class='c011'>“No person&#160;*&#160;*&#160;* shall be compelled in any criminal
case to be a witness against himself, nor be deprived of
life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.”</p>

<p class='c007'>It has been the practice of the Department of Justice and
its agents, after making illegal arrests without warrant, to
question and to force admission from him by terrorism, which
admissions were subsequently to be used against him in deportation
proceedings.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>
  <h3 class='c019'>(6) <i>Propaganda by the Department of Justice</i>:</h3>
</div>

<p class='c018'>The legal functions of the Attorney General are: to advise
the Government on questions of law, and to prosecute persons
who have violated federal statutes. For the Attorney General to
go into the field of propaganda against radicals is a deliberate
misuse of his office and a deliberate squandering of funds
entrusted to him by Congress.&#160;*&#160;*&#160;*</p>

<p class='c007'>Since these illegal acts have been committed by the highest
legal powers in the United States, there is no final appeal from
them except to the conscience and condemnation of the American
people. American institutions have not in fact been protected
by the Attorney General’s ruthless suppression. On the contrary
these institutions have been seriously undermined, and revolutionary
unrest has been vastly intensified. No organizations of
radicals acting through propaganda over the last six months
could have created as much revolutionary sentiment in America
as has been created by the acts of the Department of Justice
itself.</p>

<p class='c007'>Even were one to admit that there existed any serious “Red
menace” before the Attorney General started his “unflinching
war” against it, his campaign has been singularly fruitless. Out
of the many thousands suspected by the Attorney General (he
had already listed 60,000 by name and history on November 14,
1919, aliens and citizens) what do the figures show of net results?
Prior to January 1, 1920, there were actually deported 263
persons. Since January 1 there have been actually deported 18
persons. Since January 1 there have been ordered deported an
additional 529 persons and warrants for 1,547 have been
cancelled (after full hearings and consideration of the evidence)
by Assistant Secretary of Labor Louis F. Post, to whose
courageous re-establishment of American Constitutional Law in
deportation proceedings are due the attacks that have been made
upon him. The Attorney General has consequently got rid of
810 alien suspects, which, on his own showing, leaves him at
least 59,160 persons (aliens and citizens) still to cope with.</p>

<p class='c007'>It has always been the proud boast of America that this is
a government of laws and not of men. Our Constitution and
laws have been based on the simple elements of human nature.
Free men cannot be driven and repressed; they must be led.
Free men respect justice and follow truth, but arbitrary power
they will oppose until the end of time. There is no danger of
revolution so great as that created by suppression, by ruthlessness,
and by deliberate violation of the simple rules of American
law and American decency.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>It is a fallacy to suppose that, any more than in the past,
any servant of the people can safely arrogate to himself unlimited
authority. To proceed upon such a supposition is to deny
the fundamental American theory of the consent of the governed.
Here is no question of a vague and threatened menace, but a
present assault upon the most sacred principles of our Constitutional
liberty.</p>

<p class='c007'>The raids were particularly intense and violent in the
industrial towns round Boston and culminated in the captives
being driven through the streets of Boston chained together in
fours. There were raids in Boston, Chelsea, Brockton, Bridgewater,
Norwood, Worcester, Springfield, Chicopee Falls, Lowell,
Fitchburg, Holyoke, Lawrence and Haverhill. Unfortunate
people after being beaten up and put through the third degree
were concentrated at Deer Island under the conditions that have
become public through U. S. Circuit Judge Anderson’s decision
on the cases that came up before him.</p>

<p class='c007'>Now it is this ring of industrial towns round Boston that
furnish the background of the Sacco-Vanzetti case. There is
no doubt that the American born public in these towns on the
whole sympathizes with the activities of the detectives. The
region has been for many years one of the most intense industrial
battlegrounds in the country. People slept safer in their beds
at the thought of all these agitators, bombsters, garlic-smelling
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>wops, and unwashed Russians being under lock and key at Deer
Island.</p>

<p class='c007'>Eastern Massachusetts has a threefold population living
largely from manufacturing of textiles and shoes and other
leather goods. With the decline of shipping and farming the
old simonpure New England stock, Congregationalist in faith,
Republican in politics, has been pretty well snowed under by the
immigration first of Irish Catholics, congenital Democrats and
readers of Hearst papers, now assimilated and respectable, and
then of Italians, Poles, Slovaks, transplanted European peasants
tenderly known to newspaper readers as the scum of the Mediterranean
or the scum of Central Europe. There’s no love lost
between the first two classes, but they unite on the question of
wops, guineas, dagoes. The January raids, the attitude of press
and pulpit, howling about atrocities, civilization (which usually
means bank accounts) endangered, women nationalized, put the
average right-thinking citizen into such a state of mind that
whenever he smelt garlic on a man’s breath he walked past
quickly for fear of being knifed. A roomful of people talking
a foreign language was most certainly a conspiracy to overturn
the Government. Read over the articles in the <cite>Boston Transcript</cite>
on the soviet conspiracy at that time and you will see what kind
of stuff was being ladled out even to the intelligent highbrow
section of the entrenched classes.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was into this atmosphere of rancor and suspicion, fear
of holdups and social overturn that burst the scare headlines of
the South Braintree murders. Pent-up hatred found an outlet
when the police in Brockton arrested Sacco and Vanzetti, wops
who spoke broken English, anarchists who believed neither in
the Pope nor in the Puritan God, slackers and agitators, charged
with a peculiarly brutal and impudent crime. Since that
moment these people have had a focus for their bitter hatred of
the new, young, vigorous, unfamiliar forces that are relentlessly
sweeping them on to the shelf. The people of Norfolk county
and of all Massachusetts decided they wanted these men to die.</p>

<p class='c007'>Meanwhile the red delirium over the rest of the country had
slackened. Something had happened that had made many people
pause and think.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>About dawn on May 3rd the body of Andrea Salsedo, an
anarchist printer, was found smashed on the pavement of Park
Row in New York. He had jumped or been thrown from the
offices of the Department of Justice on the fourteenth floor of
the Park Row building, where he and his friend Elia had been
secretly imprisoned for eight weeks. Evidently they had continually
tortured him during that time; Mr. Palmer’s detectives
were “investigating” anarchist activity. A note had been
smuggled out somehow, and a few days before Vanzetti had been
in New York as the delegate of an Italian group to try to get
the two men out on bail. After Salsedo’s death Elia was hurried
over to Ellis Island and deported. He died in Italy. But from
that time on the holy enthusiasm for red-baiting subsided. That
tortured body found dead and bleeding in one of the most central
and public spots in New York shocked men back into their
senses.</p>

<p class='c007'>When Sacco and Vanzetti were arrested in the trolley car
in Brockton the night of May 5th, Sacco had in his pocket the
draft of a poster announcing a meeting of protest against what
they considered the murder of their comrade. They were going
about warning the other members of their group to hide all
incriminating evidence in the way of “radical” books and papers
so that, in the new raid that they had been tipped off to expect,
they should not be arrested and meet the fate of Salsedo.</p>

<p class='c007'>Don’t forget that people had been arrested and beaten up
for distributing the Declaration of Independence.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c006'>IV<br> THE PSYCHOLOGY OF FRAME-UPS</h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>But why were these men held as murderers and highwaymen
and not as anarchists and advocates of the working people?</p>

<p class='c007'>It was a frameup.</p>

<p class='c007'>That does not <i>necessarily</i> mean that any set of government
and employing class detectives deliberately planned to fasten the
crime of murder on Sacco and Vanzetti. Though in this case it
is almost certain that they did.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>The frameup is an unconscious (occasionally semiconscious)
mechanism. An unconscious mechanism is a kink in the mind
that makes people do something without knowing why they do
it, and often without knowing that they are doing it. It is the
sub-rational act of a group, serving in this case, through a series
of pointed unintentions, the ends of a governing class.</p>

<p class='c007'>Among a people that does not recognize or rather does not
admit the force and danger of ideas it is impossible to prosecute
the holder of unpopular ideas directly. Also there is a smouldering
tradition of freedom that makes those who do it feel guilty.
After all everyone learnt the Declaration of Independence and
<i>Give me Liberty or Give me Death</i> in school, and however
perfunctory the words have become they have left a faint
infantile impression on the minds of most of us. Hence the
characteristic American weapon of the frameup. If a cop wants
to arrest a man he suspects of selling dope he plants a gun on
him and arrests him under the Sullivan Law. If a man is organizing
a strike in a dangerously lively way you try to frame him
under the Mann Act or else you get hold of a woman to sue him
for breach of promise. If a representative votes against war
you have him arrested for breach of decency in an automobile
on a Virginia roadside. If two Italians are spreading anarchist
propaganda, you hold them for murder.</p>

<p class='c007'>The frameup is a process that you can’t help feeling, but like
most unconscious processes it’s very hard to trace step by step.
Half the agents in such a process don’t really know what they
are doing. Hence the average moderately fairminded newspaper
reader who never has had personal experience of a frameup in
action is flabbergasted when you tell him that such and such a
man who is being prosecuted for wifebeating is really being
prosecuted because he knows the origin of certain bonds in a
District Attorney’s safe.</p>

<p class='c007'>In this neatly swept courtroom in Dedham with everything
so varnished and genteel it is hardly possible to think of such a
thing as a frameup, and yet.... Under these elms, in these
white oldtime houses of Dedham, in front of these pious Georgian
doorways.... The court has for the seventh time affirmed its
will to send two innocent men to the electric chair.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>
  <h2 class='c006'>V<br> THE OUTLAW CREED</h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>But what is this criminal garlic-smelling creed that the
people of Massachusetts will not face openly?</p>

<p class='c007'>For half a century Anarchy has been the bogy of American
schoolmasters, policemen, old maids, and small town mayors.
About the time of the assassination of McKinley a picture was
formed in the public mind of the anarchist; red-handed, unwashed
foreigner whom nobody could understand, sticks of dynamite in
his pocket and bomb in the paper parcel under his arm, redeyed
housewrecker waiting only for the opportunity to bite the hand
that fed him. Since the Russian Revolution the picture has
merged a little with that of the sneaking, slinking, communist
Jew, enviously undermining Prosperity and Decency through
secret organizations ruled from Moscow.</p>

<p class='c007'>Gradually among liberals and intelligent people generally
certain phases of anarchism have meanwhile been reluctantly
admitted into respectable conversation under the phrase
‘philosophical anarchist’, which means an anarchist who shaves
daily, has good manners and is guaranteed not to act on his
beliefs. Certain people of the best society, such as Kropotkin
and Tolstoy, princes both, having through their anarchy made
themselves important figures in European thought and literature,
it was impossible to exclude them longer from the pale of
decency.</p>

<p class='c007'>What is this outlaw creed?</p>

<p class='c007'>When Christianity flourished in the Mediterranean basin,
slave and emperor had the hope of the immediate coming of
Christ’s kingdom, the golden Jerusalem that would appear on
earth to put an end to the tears and aches of the faithful. After
the first millennium, the City of God, despaired of on earth, took
its permanent place in the cloudy firmament with the Virgin
Mary at the apex of the feudal pyramid. With the decay of
feudalism and the coming of the kingdoms of this world the
church became more and more the instrument of the governing
orders. Undermined by the eighteenth century, overthrown by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>the French revolution, the church was restored by the great
reaction as the strongest bulwark of Privilege. But in the
tough memories of peasants and fishermen—their sons worked in
factories—there remained a faint trace of the vanished brightness
of the City of God. All our citydwelling instinct and
culture has been handed down to us from these countless urban
generations, Cretans, Greeks, Phoenicians, Latins of the
Mediterranean basin, Italians of the hilltowns. It is natural that
the dwellers on those scraggy hills in sight of that always blue
sea should have kept alight in their hearts the perfect city,
where the strong did not oppress the weak, where every man
lived by his own work at peace with his neighbors, the white
Commune where man could reach his full height free from the
old snarling obsessions of god and master.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is this inner picture that is the core of feeling behind all
anarchist theory and doctrine. Many Italians planted the perfect
city of their imagination in America. When they came to this
country they either killed the perfect city in their hearts and
submitted to the system of dawg eat dawg or else they found
themselves anarchists. There have been terrorists among them,
as in every other oppressed and despised sect since the world
began. Good people generally have contended that anarchism
and terrorism were the same thing, a silly and usually malicious
error much fostered by private detectives and the police bomb-squads.</p>

<p class='c007'>An anarchist workman who works for the organization of
his fellow workmen is a man who costs the factory owners
money; thereby he is a bomb-thrower and possible murderer in
the minds of the majority of American employers.</p>

<p class='c007'>In his charge to the jury in the Plymouth trial Judge
Thayer definitely said that the crime of highway robbery was
consistent with Vanzetti’s ideals as a radical.</p>

<p class='c007'>Yet under the conflict between employer and workman, and
the racial misunderstanding, in themselves material enough for
the creation of a frameup, might there not be a deeper bitterness?
The people of Massachusetts centuries ago suffered and hoped
terribly for the City of God. This little white courthouse town
of Dedham, neat and exquisite under its elms, is the symbol of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>a withered hope, mortgaged at six per cent to the kingdoms of
this world. It is natural that New Englanders, who feel in
themselves a lingering of the passionate barbed desire of
perfection of their ancestors, should hate with particular
bitterness, anarchists, votaries of the Perfect Commune on earth.
The irrational features of this case of attempted communal
murder can only be explained by a bitterness so deep that it has
been forgotten by the very people it moves most fervidly.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c006'>VI<br> FREE MEN</h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>It was about dawn on Monday, May 3rd, 1920, that the body
of Andrea Salsedo was found smashed on the pavement of Park
Row. At that time Bartolomeo Vanzetti was peddling fish in
the pleasant little Italian and Portuguese town of North Plymouth.
He was planning to go into fishing himself in partnership with
a man who owned some dories. Early mornings, pushing his
cart up and down the long main street, ringing his bell, chatting
with housewives in Piedmontese, Tuscan, pidgin English, he
worried about the raids, the imprisonment of comrades, the
lethargy of the working people. He was an anarchist, after the
school of Galleani. Between the houses he could see the gleaming
stretch of Plymouth Bay, the sandy islands beyond, the white
dories at anchor. About three hundred years before, men from
the west of England had first sailed into the grey shimmering
bay that smelt of woods and wild grape, looking for something;
liberty&#160;... freedom to worship God in their own manner&#160;...
space to breathe. Thinking of these things, worrying as
he pushed the little cart loaded with eels, haddock, cod, halibut,
swordfish, Vanzetti spent his mornings making change, weighing
out fish, joking with the housewives. It was better than working
at the great cordage works that own North Plymouth.
Some years before he had tried to organize a strike there and
been blacklisted. The officials and detectives at the Plymouth
Cordage Works, the largest cordage works in the world, thought
of him as a Red, a slacker and troublemaker.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>His life up to his settling in Plymouth you can read in his
own words in these extracts from the <cite>Story of a Proletarian Life</cite>
that he wrote in Charlestown jail:</p>

<p class='c011'>My life cannot claim the dignity of an autobiography.
Nameless, in the crowd of nameless ones, I have merely caught
and reflected a little of the light from that dynamic thought or
ideal which is drawing humanity towards better destinies.</p>

<p class='c011'>I was born on June 11, 1888, of G. Battista Vanzetti and
Giovanna Vanzetti, in Villafalletto, province of Cuneo, in Piedmont.
The town, which rises on the right bank of the Magra,
in the shadows of a beautiful chain of hills, is primarily an
agricultural community. Here I lived until the age of thirteen
in the bosom of my family.</p>

<p class='c011'>I attended the local schools and loved study. My earliest
memories are of prizes won in school examinations, including a
second prize in the religious catechism. My father was undecided
whether to let me prosecute studies or to apprentice me to some
artisan. One day he read in the <cite>Gazzetta del Popolo</cite> that in
Turin forty-two lawyers had applied for a position paying 35
lire monthly. The news item proved decisive in my boyhood, for
it left my father determined that I should learn a trade and
become a shop-keeper.</p>

<p class='c011'>And so in the year 1901 he conducted me to Signor Conino,
who ran a pastry shop in the city of Cuneo, and left me there
to taste, for the first time, the flavor of hard, relentless labor.
I worked for about twenty months there—from seven o’clock
each morning until ten at night, every day, except for a three-hour
vacation twice a month. From Cuneo I went to Cavour
and found myself installed in the bakery of Signor Goitre, a
place that I kept for three years. Conditions were no better
than in Cuneo, except that the fortnightly free period was of
five hours duration.</p>

<p class='c011'>I did not like the trade, but I stuck to it to please my father
and because I did not know what else to choose. In 1905 I
abandoned Cavour for Turin in the hope of locating work in the
big city. Failing in this hope, I went on further to Courgne
where I remained working six months. Then back to Turin, on
a job as caramel-maker.</p>

<p class='c011'>In Turin, in February of 1907, I fell seriously ill. I was
in great pain, confined indoors, deprived of air and sun and joy,
like a “sad twilight flower.” But news of my plight reached the
family and my father came from Villafalletto to take me back
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>to my birthplace. At home, he told me, I would be cared for
by my mother, my good, my best-beloved mother.</p>

<p class='c008'>Science did not avail, nor love. After three months of
brutal illness she breathed her last in my arms. She died
without hearing me weep. It was I who laid her in her coffin;
I who accompanied her to the final resting place; I who threw
the first handful of earth over her bier. And it was right that
I should do so, for I was burying part of myself.... The void
left has never been filled.</p>

<p class='c008'>This desperate state of mind decided me to abandon Italy
for America. On June 9, 1908, I left my dear ones. My sorrow
was so great at the parting that I kissed my relatives and
strained them to my bosom without being able to speak. My
father, too, was speechless in his profound sorrow, and my
sisters wept as they did when my mother died. My going had
excited interest in the village and the neighbors crowded the
house, each with a word of hope, a blessing, a tear. In a crowd
they followed me far out on the road, as if a townsman were
being exiled forever.</p>

<p class='c008'>After a two-day railway ride across France and more than
seven days on the ocean, I arrived in the Promised Land. New
York loomed on the horizon in all its grandness and illusion of
happiness. I strained my eyes from the steerage deck, trying to
see through this mass of masonry that was at once inviting and
threatening to the huddled men and women in the third class.</p>

<p class='c011'>In the immigration station I had my first great surprise.
I saw the steerage passengers handled by the officials like so
many animals. Not a word of kindness, of encouragement, to
lighten the burden of fears that rests heavily upon the newly
arrived on American shores. Hope, which lured these immigrants
to the new land, withers under the touch of harsh
officials. Little children who should be alert with expectancy,
cling instead to their mothers’ skirts, weeping with fright.
Such is the unfriendly spirit that exists in the immigration
barracks.</p>

<p class='c011'>How well I remember standing at the Battery, in lower New
York, upon my arrival, alone, with a few poor belongings in the
way of clothes, and very little money. Until yesterday I was
among folks who understood me. This morning I seemed to
have awakened in a land where my language meant little more to
the native (so far as meaning is concerned) than the pitiful
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>noises of a dumb animal. Where was I to go? What was I to
do? Here was the promised land. The elevated rattled by and
did not answer. The automobiles and the trolleys sped by,
heedless of me.</p>

<p class='c011'>I had note of one address, and thither a fellow-passenger
conducted me. It was the house of a countryman of mine, on
—— street, near Seventh Avenue. I remained there a while, but it
became all too evident that there was no room for me in his
house, which was overstocked with human beings, like all
workingmen’s houses. In deep melancholy I left the place
towards eight in the evening to look for a place to sleep. I
retraced my steps to the Battery, where I took a bed for the
night in a suspicious-looking establishment, the best I could
afford. Three days after my arrival, the compatriot already
mentioned, who was head cook in a rich club on West ——
street overlooking the Hudson River, found me a post in his
kitchen as dishwasher. I worked there three months. The
hours were long; the garret where we slept was suffocatingly
hot; and the vermin did not permit me to close an eye. Almost
every night I sought escape in the park.</p>

<p class='c011'>Leaving this place, I found the same kind of employment
in the Mouquin Restaurant. What the conditions there are at
present I do not know. But at that time, thirteen years ago,
the pantry was horrible. There was not a single window in it.
When the electric light for some reason was out, it was totally
dark, so that one couldn’t move without running into things.
The vapor of the boiling water where the plates, pans and silver
were washed formed great drops of water on the ceiling, took
up all the dust and grime there, then fell slowly one by one upon
my head, as I worked below. During working hours the heat
was terrific. The table leavings amassed in barrels near the
pantry gave out nauseating exhalations. The sinks had no direct
sewerage connection. Instead, the water was permitted to
overrun to the floor. In the center of the room there was a
drain. Every night the pipe was clogged and the greasy water
rose higher and higher and we trudged in the slime.</p>

<p class='c011'>We worked twelve hours one day and fourteen the next,
with five hours off every Sunday. Damp food hardly fit for dogs
and five or six dollars a week was the pay. After eight months
I left the place for fear of contracting consumption.</p>

<p class='c011'>That was a sad year. What toiler does not remember it?
The poor slept outdoors and rummaged the garbage barrels to
find a cabbage leaf or a rotten potato. For three months I
searched New York, its length and its breadth, without finding
work. One morning, in an employment agency, I met a young
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>man more forlorn and unfortunate than I. He had gone without
food the day before and was still fasting. I took him to a
restaurant, investing almost all that remained to me of my
savings in a meal which he ate with wolfish voracity. His
hunger stilled, my new friend declared that it was stupid to
remain in New York. If he had the money, he said, he would go
to the country, where there was more chance of work, without
counting the pure air and the sun which could be had for
nothing. With the money remaining in my possession we took
the steamboat for Hartford, Connecticut, the same day.</p>

<p class='c008'>From Worcester I transferred to Plymouth (that was about
seven years ago), which remained my home until the time I
was arrested. I learned to look upon the place with a real
affection, because as time went on it held more and more of
the people dear to my heart, the folks I boarded with, the men
who worked by my side, the women who later bought the wares
I had to offer as a peddler.</p>

<p class='c011'>In passing, let me say how gratifying it is to realize that
my compatriots in Plymouth reciprocate the love I feel for them.
Not only have they supported my defense—money is a slight
thing after all—but they have expressed to me directly and
indirectly their faith in my innocence. Those who rallied around
my good friends of the defense committee, were not only
workers, but businessmen who knew me; not only Italians, but
Jews, Poles, Greeks and Americans.</p>

<p class='c011'>Well, I worked in the Stone establishment for more than
a year, and then for the Cordage Company for about eighteen
months. My active participation in the Plymouth cordage strike
made it certain that I could never get a job there.... As a
matter of fact, because of my more frequent appearance on the
speaker’s platform in working class groups of every kind, it
became increasingly difficult to get work anywhere. So far as
certain factories were concerned I was definitely “blacklisted.”
Yet, every one of my many employers could testify that I was
an industrious, dependable workman, that my chief fault was
in trying so hard to bring a little light of understanding into
the dark lives of my fellow workers. For some time I did
manual work of the hardest kind in the construction undertakings
of Sampson &#38; Douland, for the city. I can almost say
that I have participated in all the principal public works in
Plymouth. Almost any Italian in the town or any of my foremen
of my various jobs can attest my industry and modesty of life
during this period. I was deeply interested by this time in the
things of the intellect, in the great hope that animates me even
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>here in the dark cell of a prison while I await death for a crime
I did not commit.</p>

<p class='c011'>My health was not good. The years of toil and the more
terrible periods of unemployment had robbed me of much of my
original vitality. I was casting about for some salutary means
of eking out my livelihood. About eight months before my
arrest a friend of mine who was planning to return to the home
country said to me: “Why don’t you buy my cart, my knives, my
scales, and go to selling fish instead of remaining under the
yoke of the bosses?” I grasped the opportunity, and so became
a fish-vender, largely out of love for independence.</p>

<p class='c011'>At that time, 1919, the desire to see once more my dear ones
at home, the nostalgia for my native land had entered my heart.
My father, who never wrote a letter without inviting me home,
insisted more than ever, and my good sister Luigia joined in his
pleas. Business was none too fat, but I worked like a beast of
burden, without halt or stay, day after day.</p>

<p class='c011'>December 24, the day before Christmas, was the last day
I sold fish that year. A brisk day of business I had, since all
Italians buy eels that day for the Christmas Eve feasts. Readers
may recall that it was a bitter-cold Christmas, and the harsh
weather did not let up after the holidays; and pushing a cart
along is not warming work. I went for a short period to more
vigorous, even if no less freezing work. I got a job a few days
after Christmas cutting ice for Mr. Petersani. One day, when
he hadn’t enough to go round, I shovelled coal for the Electric
House. When the ice job was finished I got employment with
Mr. Howland, ditch-digging, until a snow storm made me a man
of leisure again. Not for longer than a few hours. I hired
myself out to the town, cleaning the streets of the snow, and this
work done, I helped clean the snow from the railroad tracks.
Then I was taken on again by the Sampson Construction people
who were laying a water main for the Puritan Woolen Company.
I stayed on the job until it was finished.</p>

<p class='c011'>Again I found no job. The railroad strike difficulties had
cut off the cement supply, so that there was no more construction
work going on. I went back to my fish-selling, when I could
get none, I dug for clams, but the profit on these was lilliputian,
the expenses being so high that they left no margin. In April I
reached an agreement with a fisherman for a partnership. It
never materialized, because on May 5, while I was preparing a
mass meeting to protest against the death of Salsedo at the
hands of the Department of Justice, I was arrested. My good
friend and comrade Nicola Sacco was with me.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Another deportation case,” we said to one another.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>At the same time Nicola Sacco was living in Stoughton,
working an edging machine at the Three K’s shoe factory, where
star workmen sometimes make as high as eighty or ninety dollars
a week. He had a pretty wife and a little son named Dante.
There was another baby coming. He lived in a bungalow
belonging to his employer, Michael Kelley. The house adjoined
Kelley’s own house and the men were friends. Often Kelley
advised him to lay off this anarchist stuff. There was no money
in it. It was dangerous the way people felt nowadays. Sacco
was a clever young fellow and could soon get to be a prosperous
citizen, maybe own a factory of his own some day, live by other
men’s work. But Sacco working in his garden in the early
morning before the whistles blew, hilling beans, picking off
potatobugs, letting grains of corn slip by threes or fours through
his fingers into the finely worked earth, worried about things.
He was an anarchist. He loved the earth and people, he wanted
them to walk straight over the free hills, not to stagger bowed
under the ordained machinery of industry; he worried mornings
working in his garden at the lethargy of the working people. It
was not enough that he was happy and had fifteen hundred or
more dollars in the bank for a trip home to Italy.</p>

<p class='c007'>Two men sitting on a bench in the bright birdcage of
Dedham jail. When he wants to, one of them will get up and
go out, walk along the street, turn his nose into the wind, look
up at the sky and clouds, board streetcars, buy train tickets.
The other will go back to his cell. Twentythree hours a day in a
cell for a thousand days, for three years, for six years, now the
seventh year is tediously unreeling.... Sacco in prisonclothes,
with the prison pallor under the black hair on his head, with
the prison strain under his eyes, in grey baggy prison clothes,
telling about his life in the unimaginable days when he was free.
A bell rings; the prisoners file by to the messroom, putty faces,
slouched bodies in baggy grey denim, their hands tucked under
their folded arms.... Sacco was born in Torremaggiore in the
province of Foggia in the sunny southern foothills of the
Appenines; his father was a substantial Italian peasant who
married the daughter of an oil and wine merchant. His father
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>belonged to the republican club of the town, his older brother
Sabino was a socialist. He went to school and worked in his
father’s vineyards and helped with the olive oil business. His
oldest brother Nicola (whose name he afterwards took; when a
child he was known as Ferdinando) died, Sabino was conscripted
into the army; that left him the head of the family. He was
often sent round the country in a cart to make payments for his
father, to pay off workmen or buy supplies. He was the trusted
boy of the family. But better than anything he liked machines.
Summers when there was nothing that needed doing in the vineyard
he worked stoking the big steam threshing machine that
threshed all the wheat of the region. Better than school or
farming or working for his father he liked working round
engines. He dreamed about going to America, the land of
engines.</p>

<p class='c007'>When he was seventeen he set out with his brother Sabino;
they were going to make their fortunes in the land of machines
and dollars. In April 1908 they landed in Boston. Sacco had
good luck. He worked hard. He hadn’t been in this country
two weeks before he had a job as waterboy with a road gang
near Milford. He liked it especially when the engineer let him
help with the steam roller. He liked to stand beside the hot
wheezing petulant engine, stoking it with coal, squirting oil out
of an oilcan. But there wasn’t much money in it; winter came
on. He got a job in the Hopedale mills trimming the slag off
pigiron. He worked there a year. By that time he realized
that he ought to learn a definite trade. An unskilled laborer was
a mat for everybody to wipe their feet on. He paid fifty dollars
to a man to teach him to run an edging machine. A friend of
his worked as an edger in a shoefactory and made good money.
That way he would have a machine all to himself.</p>

<p class='c007'>About that time his brother Sabino had gone back to Italy,
to the oil and wine business; he had had enough of America.
Nicola wanted to stay on some more. First he got a job in a
shoefactory in Webster, but then he went back to Milford where
he worked as an edger till 1917. If he hadn’t met his wife he
would have gone home. At that time he was a socialist interested
in <cite>Il Proletario</cite>, a paper that Giovannitti edited, fond of acting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>plays with titles like <cite>Senza Padrone</cite>, <cite>Tempeste Sociali</cite>. It was
at a dance he had gotten up as a benefit for an old accordeon
player who was paralyzed, that he first met Rosa his wife. She
won a box of candy in the raffle. She was from the north of
Italy and had the dark auburn hair Lombard women are famous
for. They married and were very happy; a son was born to
them whom they named Dante.</p>

<p class='c007'>Towards 1913 Sacco began to go around to an anarchist
club, the Circolo di Studi Sociali. He found the men there more
intelligent, more anxious to read, more willing to work for the
education of their fellow workers. In 1916 the group held
manifestations of sympathy and collected money to help the
strike Carlo Tresca was running in Minnesota. The Milford
police forbade the meetings and arrested the speakers. Sacco
was among them. They were convicted in Milford for disturbing
the peace, but discharged before a superior court in Worcester.</p>

<p class='c007'>Those were exciting years, full of the rumblings of revolution.
The successful seizure of power by the Bolsheviki in
Russia made it seem that the war would end in universal
revolution. Then Mr. Wilson began his great crusade. In May
1917, with several friends, Sacco went south to Mexico to avoid
registering for the draft. It was on the train he first met Vanzetti.</p>

<p class='c007'>When he came back from Mexico three months later he
worked in a candy factory in Cambridge, then in East Boston
and at last moved out to Stoughton, where he was a trusted man
in the Three K’s Factory of the Kelleys.</p>

<p class='c007'>Sacco before his arrest was unusually powerfully built, able
to do two men’s work. In prison he was able to stand thirtyone
days of hunger strike before he broke down and had to be taken
to the hospital. In prison he has learned to speak and write
English, has read many books, for the first time in his life has
been thrown with nativeborn Americans. They are so hard and
brittle. They don’t fit into the bright clear heartfelt philosophy
of Latin anarchism. These are the people who coolly want him
to die in the electric chair. He can’t understand them. When
his head was cool he’s never wanted anyone to die. Judge Thayer
and the prosecution he thinks of as instruments of a machine.</p>

  <h2 class='c006'>VII<br> SLACKERS, REDS</h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Three years before Sacco and Vanzetti had both of them
had their convictions put to the test. In 1917, against the
expressed votes of the majority, Woodrow Wilson had allowed
the United States to become involved in the war with Germany.
When the law was passed for compulsory military service a
registration day for citizens and aliens was announced. Most
young men submitted whatever their convictions were. A few
of those who were morally opposed to any war or to capitalist
war had the nerve to protest. Sacco and Vanzetti and some
friends ran away to Mexico. There, some thirty of them lived
in a set of adobe houses. Those who could get jobs worked. It
was share and share alike. Everything was held in common.
There were in the community men of all trades and conditions;
bakers, butchers, tailors, shoemakers, cooks, carpenters, waiters.
Sacco got a job in a bakery and when the others were hard up
would take his pay in bread. Saturday nights he’d trudge
home to the community with a bag of fresh loaves of bread over
his shoulder. It was a momentary realization of the hope of
anarchism. But living was difficult in Mexico and they began
to get letters from the States telling that it was possible to
avoid the draft, telling of high wages. Little by little they
filtred back across the border. Sacco and Vanzetti went back
to Massachusetts.</p>

<p class='c007'>There was an Italian club that met Sunday evenings in a
hall in Maverick Square, East Boston, under the name of the
Italian Naturalization Club. Workmen from the surrounding
industrial towns met to play bowls and discuss social problems.
There were anarchists, syndicalists, socialists of various colors.
The Russian revolution had fired them with new hopes. The
persecution of their comrades in various parts of America had
made them feel the need for mutual help. While far away across
the world new eras seemed to be flaring up into the sky, at home
the great machine they slaved for seemed more adamant, more
unshakable than ever. Everywhere aliens were being arrested,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>tortured, deported. To the war heroes who had remained at
home any foreigner seemed a potential Bolshevik, a menace to
the security of Old Glory and liberty bonds and the bonus.
When Elia and Salsedo were arrested in New York there was
great alarm among the Italian radicals around Boston. Vanzetti
went down to New York to try to hire a lawyer for the two men.
There he heard many uneasy rumors. The possession of any
literature that might be interpreted as subversive by ignorant and
brutal agents of the departments of Justice and Labor was
dangerous. It was not that deportation was so much to be
feared, but the beating up and third degree that preceded it.</p>

<p class='c007'>On the evening of May 5th, Sacco and Vanzetti with the
handbill on them announcing a meeting of protest against what
they considered the murder of Salsedo, went by trolley from
Stoughton to West Bridgewater to meet a man named Boda
who they thought could lend them a car. Very likely they
thought they were being trailed and had put revolvers in their
pockets out of some confused feeling of bravado. If the police
pounced on them at least they would not let themselves be tortured
to death like Salsedo. But they were afraid to use Boda’s
car because it lacked a 1920 license plate and started back to
Stoughton on the trolley, probably very uneasy. When they
were arrested as the trolley entered Brockton they forgot all
about their guns. They thought they were being arrested as
Reds in connection with the projected meeting. When they were
questioned at the police station their main care was not to
implicate any of their friends. They kept remembering the dead
body of Salsedo, smashed on the pavement of Park Row.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c006'>VIII<br> JAILBIRDS</h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>The faces of men who have been a long time in jail have a
peculiar frozen look under the eyes. The face of a man who has
been a long time in jail never loses that tightness under the eyes.
Sacco has been six years in the county jail, always waiting,
waiting for trial, waiting for new evidence, waiting for motions
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>to be argued, waiting for sentence, waiting, waiting, waiting.
The Dedham jail is a handsome structure, set among lawns,
screened by trees that wave new green leaves against the
robinsegg sky of June. In the warden’s office you can see your
face in the light brown varnish, you could eat eggs off the
floor it is so clean. Inside the main reception hall is airy, full
of sunlight. The bars are bright with reflected spring greens, a
fresh peagreen light is over everything. Through the bars you
can see the waving trees and the June clouds roaming the sky
like cattle in an unfenced pasture. It’s a preposterous complicated
canary cage. Why aren’t the birds singing in this green
aviary? The warden politely shows you a seat and as you wait
you notice a smell, not green and airy this smell, a jaded heavy
greasy smell of slum, like the smell of army slum, but heavier,
more hopeless.</p>

<p class='c007'>Across the hall an old man is sitting in a chair, a heavy
pearshaped man, his hands limp at his sides, his eyes are closed,
his sagged face is like a bundle of wet newspapers. The warden
and two men in black stand over him, looking down at him
helplessly.</p>

<p class='c007'>At last Sacco has come out of his cell and sits beside me.
Two men sitting side by side on a bench in a green, bird cage.
When he feels like it one of them will get up and walk out, walk
out into the sunny June day. The other will go back to his cell
to wait. He looks younger than I had expected. His face has
a waxy transparency like the face of a man who’s been sick in
bed for a long time; when he laughs his cheeks flush a little. At
length we manage both of us to laugh. It’s such a preposterous
position for a man to be in, like a man who doesn’t know the
game trying to play chess blindfolded. The real world has gone.
We have no more grasp of our world of rain and streets and
trolleycars and cucumbervines and girls and gardenplots. This
is a world of phrases, <i>prosecution, defence, evidence, motion,
irrelevant, incompetent and immaterial</i>. For six years this man
has lived in the law, tied tighter and tighter in the sticky filaments
of law-words like a fly in a spiderweb. And the wrong set of
words means the Chair. All the moves in the game are made for
him, all he can do is sit helpless and wait, fastening his hopes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>on one set of phrases after another. In all these lawbooks, in
all this terminology of clerks of the court and counsel for the
defence there is one move that will save him, out of a million
that will mean death. If only they make the right move, use
the right words. But by this time the nagging torment of hope
has almost stopped, not even the thought of his wife and children
out there in the world, unreachable, can torture him now. He
is numb now, can laugh and look quizzically at the ponderous
machine that has caught and mangled him. Now it hardly
matters to him if they do manage to pull him out from between
the cogs, and the wrong set of words means the Chair.</p>

<p class='c007'>The warden comes up to take down my name. “I hope your
wife’s better,” says Sacco. “Pretty poorly,” says the warden.
Sacco shakes his head. “Maybe she’ll get better soon, nice
weather.” I have shaken his hand, my feet have carried me to
the door, past the baggy pearshaped man who is still collapsed
half deflated in the chair, closed crinkled eyelids twitching. The
warden looks into my face with a curious smile. “Leaving us?”
he asks. Outside in the neat streets the new green leaves are
swaying in the sunlight, birds sing, klaxons grunt, a trolleycar
screeches round a corner. Overhead the white June clouds
wander in the unfenced sky.</p>

<p class='c010'>Going to the State Prison at Charlestown is more like
going to Barnum and Baileys. There’s a great scurry of guards,
groups of people waiting outside; inside a brass band is playing
<i>Home Sweet Home</i>. When at length you get let into the Big
Show, you find a great many things happening at once. There are
rows of chairs where pairs of people sit talking. Each pair
is made up of a free man and a convict. In three directions
there are grey bars and tiers of cells. The band inside plays
bangingly “If Auld Acquaintance Be Forgot.” A short broadshouldered
man is sitting quiet through all the uproar, smiling
a little under his big drooping mustache. He has a domed, pale
forehead and black eyes surrounded by many little wrinkles.
The serene modeling of his cheek-bones and hollow cheeks
makes you forget the prison look under his eyes.</p>

<p class='c007'>This is Vanzetti.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>And for the last six years, three hundred and sixtyfive days
a year, yesterday, today, tomorrow, Sacco and Vanzetti wake up
on their prison pallets, eat prison food, have an hour of exercise
and conversation a day, sit in their cells puzzling about this
technicality and that technicality, pinning their hopes to their
alibis, to the expert testimony about the character of the barrel
of Sacco’s gun, to Madeiros’ confession and Weeks’ corroboration,
to action before the Supreme Court of the United States, and
day by day the props are dashed from under their feet and they
feel themselves being inexorably pushed towards the Chair by
the blind hatred of thousands of wellmeaning citizens, by the
superhuman, involved, stealthy, soulless mechanism of the law.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c006'>IX<br> THE PLYMOUTH TRIAL OF VANZETTI ALONE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>“But Vanzetti had a criminal record,” they tell you, “he
was serving a jail sentence when he was brought up for trial
with Sacco.”</p>

<p class='c007'>This is the story of Vanzetti’s criminal record.</p>

<p class='c007'>In 1914 Vanzetti had a job loading rope coils on freightcars
with the outside gang of the Plymouth Cordage. The Plymouth
Cordage is the largest in the world, and virtually owns
Plymouth and the surrounding towns where colonies of Italians
and Portuguese worked (at that time for a maximum of nine
dollars a week) tending the spinning machines that transform
hemp shipped up from Yucatan into rope and binder twine. On
January 17, 1916, there was a big walkout, the first in the
history of the Cordage. Vanzetti was one of the organizers of
the strike. After the plant had been shut down for a month in
the busiest season, the company conceded a raise. Since then
wages have risen to round twenty five a week. Vanzetti was
always in the front, picketing, making speeches. He was the
only employee who did not get his job back when the strike was
settled.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>At the time of the arrest of Sacco and Vanzetti there was
a general impression that the gunmen in a Buick car who
attempted to hold up a paytruck of the L. Q. White company in
Bridgewater on the morning of day before Christmas 1919, were
Italians and the same as those who had made off with the
South Braintree payroll.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was impossible to implicate Sacco in that affair as he
had been working that day. Vanzetti was his own boss, so he
could not give himself a certificate of employment. He was
taken over to Plymouth and brought to trial under Judge Thayer
in June, Mr. Katzmann prosecuting the case for the state. It is
very probable that the man hired to defend Vanzetti deliberately
gave away his client’s case. In any event he showed criminal
negligence in neglecting to file a bill of exceptions and in refusing
to allow Vanzetti to take the stand in his own defence.</p>

<p class='c007'>This is what Vanzetti himself says about it in a letter to
some friends in Mexico:</p>

<p class='c011'>“As for Mr. Vahey, he had asked me very little concerning
my defence, and, from after the preliminary hearing to the end
of the trial, he did not put to me a single new question about the
case. On the contrary, he began to promise me the electric
chair. ‘They will put you with Sacco’, and&#160;... at this point he
used to cease to speak, to begin to whistle, tracing upward spiral
motions with his right hand, its index finger straight up. This
is the sole Herculean fatigue accomplished by Mr. Vahey in my
defence, while smoking big cigars bought him by the poor Italian
people. But Mr. Vahey’s words proved that he knew before the
Plymouth trial that I would be indicted for the Braintree robbery
and slaying&#160;*&#160;*&#160;* To suppose that Mr. Vahey and his agent
Govoni might have been induced to such conduct by their
conviction of my guilt, would be as wrong as it is unjust. There
had been nothing in the case to justify, not even to excuse, such
a doubt. I have always protested my innocence; the Italian
population and some Americans of Plymouth had run in a mass
to prove it. The preliminary hearing had proved the impossibility
and inconsistency of the charge against me as the record
shows. The truth is that both the prosecution and the defence
counsel had realized that without the latter’s betrayal the frameup
in the making would have been an utter failure; hence the
betrayal.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>The Bridgewater holdup had occurred at 7.35 A. M. It was
an armed attack on three occupants of the L. Q. White Shoe
Company’s paytruck. This truck had obtained the weekly
allotment of money for White’s, said to be $33,000, at a bank in
the public square, and was on its way to the shoe factory.</p>

<p class='c007'>Its route lay northward on Broad Street, along which a
trolley track runs. One block north of the public square, Hale
Street, a narrow lane, cuts into Broad Street from the east, and
ends there. One block farther north there are railroad tracks
and a depot, the latter being set back considerably from Broad
Street to the east, so that it cannot be seen from the crime-zone.</p>

<p class='c007'>As the paytruck approached Hale Street, two men on foot
began firing at the three on board—a paymaster, a special
officer, and a chauffeur. The fire was returned. One bandit
had a revolver, and the other a shotgun. Later Vanzetti was
declared to be the shotgun man. The truck escaped around a
trolleycar.</p>

<p class='c007'>No one was injured, nor were any bullet marks afterwards
found. The bandits jumped into an automobile which waited
with engine running in Hale street, and fled.</p>

<p class='c007'>At that hour Vanzetti was actually 28 miles away—in
Plymouth, where he was well known as a fishseller. December
24th stands out always on the Italian calendar. Among the
Catholics it is a fast day, and fish is the logical food. But the
feasting spirit of the Christmas-tide is in the air, and the fish
of ordinary days is not rich enough, so the Italians eat eels.</p>

<p class='c007'>Vanzetti had taken orders in advance from numerous
families for eels. On the evening of December 23rd, he arranged
with thirteen-year-old Bertrando Brini to have him help in the
delivery of the eels. Next morning the two went through the
streets together making those deliveries. They were seen
by many people. That day stood out in Bertrando’s memory
because it was then he earned his Christmas money.</p>

<p class='c007'>Eighteen reputable witnesses vouched for Vanzetti’s whereabouts
on that day. Nine of those had been at home when he
brought the eels, and talked with him. John Di Carlo, proprietor
of a shoe store, testified that Vanzetti came to his store while he
was cleaning up that morning—between 7:15 and 7:40 A. M.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>Every hour of Vanzetti’s time that Christmas Eve was
accounted for.</p>

<p class='c007'>Those who swore that they purchased eels from him included
Mrs. Mary Fortini, Mrs. Rosa Forni, Rosa Balboni, Teresa Malaguice,
Adelaide Bongiovanni, Marquetta Fiochi, Emma Bosari,
Enrico Bastoni, a baker, and Vincent J. Longhi.</p>

<p class='c007'>All these are persons of good repute. Their testimony was
straightforward and certain. The prosecution made no serious
attempt to disprove it.</p>

<p class='c007'>Prosecutor Katzmann, who says this is solely a criminal
case, asked Di Carlo during cross-examination:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Have you ever discussed government theories over there
between you?” and “Have you discussed the question of the poor
man and the rich man between you?” (Trial record, Page 47).</p>

<p class='c007'>And when Michael Sassi, cordage worker, was testifying
for Vanzetti, the prosecutor asked: “Have you heard anything
of his political speeches to fellow workers at the Cordage?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Witnesses for the prosecution were few and inconsistent;
several altered their testimony, consciously or unconsciously, to
fit the prosecution’s needs.</p>

<p class='c007'>Frank W. Harding, better known as “Slip,” originally
described the shotgun bandit as “smooth-shaven,” according to
the Boston Globe of December 24, 1919. But in the official
transcript of the preliminary hearing of Vanzetti on May 10, he
uses five lines to describe the “overgrown Charlie Chaplin”
moustache of the same man. This description was given after
he had seen Vanzetti.</p>

<p class='c007'>Similar alteration of testimony was made by Benjamin J.
Bowles, one of the men on the paytruck. Bowles is a special
officer for the White Shoe Company and member of Chief
Stewart’s police force in Bridgewater. At the preliminary
hearing Bowles swore the shotgun man’s moustache was “short
and croppy.” But presently it became known that Policemen
Schilling and Gault, of Plymouth, together with the Chief of
Police there and various prominent persons, would testify for the
defense that Vanzetti’s moustache had been full and flowing for
years. So in the trial Bowles declared that the shotgun man’s
moustache was “bushy.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>Bowles’ “pretty positive” identification, thrice repeated at
the preliminary hearing (Page 32, preliminary record), became
“positive” in the trial. (Page 25, trial record.)</p>

<p class='c007'>Although refusing to make a positive identification for the
commonwealth, Paymaster Alfred E. Cox reversed his general
testimony at the trial and gave a description which would fit the
defendant. In the Brockton police court on May 10, Cox declared
several times that the shotgun man, in contrast to the other
bandit, was “short and of slight build” (Page 11, preliminary
record), the “short” fellow of the attacking party.</p>

<p class='c007'>This was bad for the commonwealth’s case. But it didn’t
stand. Bowles followed Cox with a “five feet eight inches”
description which fitted Vanzetti better, and said that the shotgun
man was the taller of the two. Then, when the case went
to trial, Bowles was called first and Cox carefully patterned his
description after him and let the bandit grow taller. When
Bowles again said “five feet eight inches” Cox repeated “five
feet eight inches.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Bowles gave a description of the shotgun man’s hair, eyes,
face and clothes of minute completeness. Such fullness of detail
six months after he had seen a man for only a few chaotic
seconds seems incredible. Bowles described graphically how he
helped operate the motor truck after Earl Graves, the driver,
collapsed from fright with the first bullet, and how they steered
around a trolley car directly ahead of them.</p>

<p class='c007'>And most marvelous of all—at the very time when he was
doing this, he was engaged in a pistol duel with another bandit
from the one he was describing. This other bandit, he said, was
fully eight feet away from the shotgun man. All this is in the
preliminary trial record.</p>

<p class='c007'>At the trial however the defense attorneys challenged Bowles
on the latter point and he promptly changed his testimony,
saying now that his second shot was fired at the shotgun man.
But he had just said that he was from 25 to 50 yards away when
he fired the second shot.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mrs. Georgina Brooks is an elderly woman who appears to
have supernatural powers. Buildings become transparent when
they stand in her way. She declared she saw “fire and smoke
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>from a gun” while she stood in a window of the railway station,
75 feet back from Broad Street and 300 feet from Hale Street
where the events took place.</p>

<p class='c007'>But there is a two-story frame house half-way along Broad
Street which completely shuts off an observer in that window
from any view of the crime-area!</p>

<p class='c007'>Mrs. Brooks makes no secret of being able to see only the
vague silhouette of objects before her with one of her eyes, and
she has been taking treatment for the other. But on the way
to the railroad station with a small child before the shooting,
she took observations afterwards useful to the prosecution. She
was walking north on the west side of Broad Street, she said,
when she noticed an automobile drawn up in Hale street, east of
the eastern sidewalk line on Broad Street. The rear of the car
was toward her.</p>

<p class='c007'>For some unexplained reason she became interested in that
car, although its appearance was not unusual. She led the child
across Broad Street and into Hale Street, and went out of her
way to pass around the front end of the automobile. In it, she
said, were four men. Three of these she took no notice of; but
she scrutinized the fourth—a man with a dark face, moustache
and dark soft hat, who “seemed like some kind of a foreigner.”</p>

<p class='c007'>She looked twice at this man, who in return looked at her
“severely”; and she continued to turn and look at him as she and
the child proceeded to the railroad station. That man, she
declared, to quote from the trial record, “That man, I should
judge, was the defendant.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Paymaster Cox testified at the preliminary hearing, as did
Mrs. Brooks, that Vanzetti had worn a hat. But this detail
given by Cox was carefully suppressed by the prosecution
during the trial. Chief Stewart exhibited in court a cap, which
he claimed to have taken from Vanzetti’s home; then he
produced a witness, Richard Grant Casey, who said he thought
he saw this cap on the shotgun man’s head on December 24.</p>

<p class='c007'>Maynard Freeman Shaw, 14-year-old high school prodigy,
stood behind a tree and saw the shotgun man running 145 feet
away. He was one of those who “identified” Vanzetti. He
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>admitted he never had more than a fleeting glimpse of the bandit’s
face.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I could tell he was a foreigner by the way he ran,” young
Shaw testified at the trial.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What sort of a foreigner?” asked the defense.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Either Italian or Russian.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Does an Italian or a Russian run differently from a Swede
or a Norwegian?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What is the difference?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Unsteady.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Courtroom spectators were impressed by the heroic recital
of “Slip” Harding. He described modestly his own coolness
under fire; how he stood in the open during the gun-play in the
Bridgewater attack. Some onlookers assert that Harding was
behind a tree, but he testified that he took down the number of
the bandits’ automobile as it sped away. Then he gave the
memorandum to Police Chief Stewart, he said, and failed to
keep a copy of it.</p>

<p class='c007'>When Stewart went on the witness stand he stated that he
had mislaid that important memorandum. After spending a
whole day searching for the automobile number, he had to confess
that he had lost it. Later, however, he gave “from memory” a
number which he asserted was that of the bandit-car. That
was six months after the crime. The number Stewart gave was
that of a car stolen from Francis Murphy, a Natick shoe
manufacturer, in November, 1919.</p>

<p class='c007'>Two days after the South Braintree holdup, an abandoned
Buick automobile, identified as Murphy’s, was found several miles
away. The prosecution contended that it was used in both
crimes.</p>

<p class='c007'>Vanzetti was connected with that car by the thinnest threads.
Remember the three shotgun shells found in his pocket many
days after the second holdup. The prosecutors tried to introduce
as evidence a fourth shotgun shell, alleged to have been found
alongside the automobile. Judge Thayer would not admit its
introduction.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>Whether that shell actually was found beside the car may
be questioned, in the light of a news story in the Boston Globe
of April 19. That story told of State Detective Scott and Police
Chief Jeremiah Gallivan of Braintree beating the bush for the
missing $15,000 payroll.</p>

<p class='c007'>(A curious thing about the South Braintree crime is that
no trace of the stolen money, or of the black boxes that were
said to have contained it, has been found. Stewart had an idea
it was in Coacci’s trunk. It was not there. The only mention
of any money that could possibly have come from that source
was the two thousand dollars Madeiros went South with late
in 1920. Being questioned by Mr. Thompson he refused to say
where it came from, but it is to be inferred that it was part
of the South Braintree loot.)</p>

<p class='c007'>“Their search was fruitless,” according to the Globe, “except
for finding of an empty RIFLE shell.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Failing to get the fourth shotgun shell into evidence, the
commonwealth tried another way to link Vanzetti with the Buick
car.</p>

<p class='c007'>It proceeded to build its case upon the shoulders of two
missing men—a shaky scaffolding, but one which served the
prosecution’s purposes.</p>

<p class='c007'>It put on the stand Mrs. Simon Johnson, wife of a garage
keeper, who at the request of the police, telephoned them when
Michael Boda called on the night of May 5 for his own automobile—an
Overland—which was stored in the Johnson garage.</p>

<p class='c007'>She asserted that Sacco and two other Italians
were with Boda that night, and was quite certain about it,
although her husband testified that Mrs. Johnson was in the
light when she observed the four men, and that the visitors were
in the shadow. Johnson knew Boda well, and he took an oath
that Boda had owned and driven an Overland car, but never
to his knowledge had driven a Buick.</p>

<p class='c007'>Finally, however, the prosecution summoned Napoleon
Ensher, a milkman, who said he didn’t know Boda by name, but
that he knew who was meant, and that he had once seen Boda
driving a Buick—maybe four weeks ago, maybe eight weeks
ago. There was no showing that Ensher had any knowledge
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>of different makes of automobiles, nor any explanation of how
he happened to notice what kind of a car was being driven by
a man whose name he didn’t know—a man who simply passed
one day a long time ago, passed “waving his head.” Other
makes of automobiles might easily be confused with a Buick by
a person unfamiliar with their differences.</p>

<p class='c007'>On this extremely flimsy evidence, in the face of an alibi
that would certainly have been accepted had the defense
witnesses been Americans instead of Italians, Vanzetti was
convicted of attempted highway robbery and given the enormous
sentence of from twelve to fifteen years. The indictment carried
two counts: attempt to murder and attempt to rob. Judge
Thayer instructed the jury to disregard the first count, but,
such was the feeling against the defendant that they brought in
a verdict of Guilty on both counts. Sentence however was only
passed on the latter. In his charge to the jury Judge Thayer
had said that the crime was “cognate with the defendant’s ideals”
as a radical.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>SACCO AND VANZETTI</h3>

<p class='c018'>But what sort of a trap was it into which Sacco and Vanzetti
stepped the evening of May 5th?</p>

<p class='c007'>Their arrest seems to go back to the fact that in the famous
January raids Police Chief Stewart of Bridgewater helped
Department of Justice agents rout four Lithuanians out of their
beds and drag them off to Deer Island. That seems to have
started him on a career of red-baiting.</p>

<p class='c007'>Later, at the request of the Department of Justice, he
arrested and engineered the deportation of a certain Coacci, a
member of the vaguely outlined group, readers of Galleani’s
paper, to which Sacco and Vanzetti belonged. Coacci was
deported from Ellis Island on April 18, leaving behind a wife
who was about to have a baby. Chief Stewart was worrying
about the series of holdups, committed it was thought by
Italians, which were earning the police considerable adverse
criticism in the community. Something had to be done. It was
not until Coacci had been shipped off that Stewart got the idea
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>that perhaps he might be implicated in the Bridgewater and
South Braintree crimes. It turned out that Coacci had worked
in the L. Q. White shoe factory some time before the Bridgewater
attempt. Stewart hatched the theory that perhaps the little
house where Coacci lived was the bandit headquarters. Boda
was a salesman and drove a car. Stewart found him and
questioned him. Boda’s car was being repaired at Johnson’s
garage a little down the road. Then Stewart found out from
Johnson that the car had been brought in for repairs some time
near the date of the South Braintree murders. He told him to
phone for the police if anyone came to take Boda’s car away.</p>

<p class='c007'>So Stewart, the small town cop, found himself in charge of
the case. Captain Proctor, head of the state police, stepped out
after warning him that he thought the trap had snapped on
the wrong birds. The theory elaborated by him and by Katzmann
was that the five men who committed the South Braintree
crime (years later identified by Madeiros as members of the
Morelli gang of Providence) were Boda, Orciani and Coacci,
and after their arrest, Sacco and Vanzetti thrown in to make
up the exact total. Coacci was escaping with the swag. Federal
agents had his trunk seized and brought back when he landed
in Italy, but nothing of a suspicious nature was found in it.
Orciani was found to have been at work on the day of the crime.
Boda disappeared. All of which proved conclusively that Sacco
and Vanzetti were the criminals.</p>

<p class='c007'>No one who remembers the winter of 1919–20 can deny that
even the mildest radicals, whether citizens or aliens, were looked
upon every man jack of them as criminals and bombers by the
police and good people generally all over the Union. In
conversation the phrase “He ought to be in jail” followed after
the word Red as naturally as a tail follows a dog. The news
of the death of Salsedo had thrown the few remaining Italian
radicals round Boston into a panic. That night Sacco and Vanzetti
were trying to hide incriminating literature and at the same
time to call a protest meeting in Brockton on May 9th. When they
met Boda and Orciani outside the home of the garage-keeper
Johnson in West Bridgewater that night of the fifth, they were
already pretty much alarmed. When Johnson began to make
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>excuses to them about Boda’s car, saying that they could not take
it out as it did not have the proper license plate, they must have
felt pretty uneasy. Actually Mrs. Johnson was telephoning the
police. Boda’s car was a small Overland, that would have
been hard to match with the Buick that was being looked for in
connection with the South Braintree crime, but the $2,000
reward offered by the shoe factory was worth taking a chance
for. Probably the very fact of four wops wanting to go riding
in a car was suspicious to the Johnsons. Anyway the four men
got nervous. Boda and Orciani rode off on Orciani’s motorcycle,
and Sacco and Vanzetti got aboard a street car. Crossing into
Brockton they were arrested. The police thought they were
arresting Boda.</p>

<p class='c007'>We’re going to be deported, thought Sacco and Vanzetti,
and naturally did their best not to implicate their friends and
comrades.</p>

<p class='c007'>The fact that they were armed was a piece of horrible bad
luck. If it hadn’t been for the revolvers and shotgun shells found
on them they would probably have been released as was Orciani
whom the police picked up a couple of days later. But why were
they armed, everybody asks. Vanzetti had bought the gun to
protect his earnings as a fishpeddler. It was a time of many
holdups. Sacco was accustomed to carry a gun as night watchman
at the Three K’s Factory. A great many people of all
classes get a feeling of strength and manhood out of toting a
gun. Put yourself in their place. Haven’t there been times
when you who are reading this would have been pretty embarrassed
to explain your actions if suddenly arrested and bullied
and crossquestioned by a lot of bulls in a station house? Add to
that the chance connection of revolvers, shells, the draft of an
anarchist leaflet. Many a man has died in the Chair on flimsier
evidence than that. That’s always the answer of the man in the
street when you press him about this case. Many a good guy’s
been electrocuted on less than that.</p>

<p class='c007'>It’s time that you realized fully, you who are reading this,
man or woman, laborer or whitecollar worker, that if Sacco and
Vanzetti die in the Chair as the result of a frameup based on an
unlucky accident, your chance of life will be that much slimmer,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>if you ever come to be arrested as a result of a similar unlucky
chain of circumstances. Justice can’t be embalmed in the dome
of a courthouse. It’s got to be worked for, fought for daily by
those who want it for themselves and for their neighbors.</p>

<p class='c007'>A great many men and women do realize it. That’s why
Sacco and Vanzetti are alive today.</p>

<p class='c007'>So it was that it was as a convicted highway robber that
Vanzetti was tried for murder with Sacco. If it hadn’t been
for that fact it would have been much harder to convict the
two men at Dedham.</p>

<p class='c007'>By one of those agreements of counsel that seem so ghastly
to a layman, the defense contracted not to produce character
witnesses for Vanzetti, if the prosecution abstained from
bringing up the previous conviction. It was a skeleton in
the closet, never mentioned, but on everyone’s mind all through
the trial.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c006'>X<br> THE DEDHAM TRIAL</h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Sacco and Vanzetti were found guilty of committing a
$15,776 payroll robbery and murdering Frederick Parmenter,
paymaster, and Alexander Berardelli, payroll guard, at South
Braintree, Mass., on April 15, 1920. Parmenter and Berardelli
were employees of the Slater and Morrill Shoe Company.</p>

<p class='c007'>Both defendants were tried before Superior Judge Webster
Thayer at Dedham in June and July 1921, the trial extending
seven weeks, and were convicted of first degree murder by a
jury which the defense attorneys contend was irregularly and
illegally selected. The verdict carries a penalty of death in the
electric chair.</p>

<p class='c007'>The crime was committed at 3.05 p. m. on Pearl street, in
front of the four-story Rice and Hutchins shoe factory. This
building was filled with workers. Four rows of windows looked
out upon the scene of the shooting. While the glass in them
was opaque, as soon as the shots were heard, many windows
were thrown open.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>Many other workers saw the crime from the windows of the
Slater and Morrill shoe factory a short distance west of the Rice
and Hutchins plant. And directly opposite was an excavation
where numerous laborers were at work.</p>

<p class='c007'>Just before the shooting a train had come in letting off
passengers at the nearby railroad station. Numerous persons
were on the street as the bandits fled, their number swelled
quickly by the sound of the shots and the wave of excitement
that traveled like the wind through the small town. Westward
on Pearl Street the bandit-automobile sped, crossing the New
Haven tracks increasing in speed as it proceeded, and continuing
the main streets of the town.</p>

<p class='c007'>This was but one of a series of payroll robberies in Eastern
Massachusetts, of which the perpetrators had invariably
escaped. These bandits too, got away. The authorities were
on the defensive; public indignation was high. Search for the
bandits was participated in by the state police and local police,
with the active co-operation of the Department of Justice and
various agencies employed by the allied manufacturing and
banking interests. These included the Pinkerton Detective
Agency, acting in the behalf of the Travelers’ Insurance Company,
which insured the Slater and Morrill payroll. Investigation by
these forces continued from April 15, 1920 to May 31, 1921, when
Sacco and Vanzetti were brought to trial.</p>

<p class='c007'>Of the scores who saw the crime and escape, and with so
many powerful agencies co-operating in the search, how many
witnesses were brought against Sacco and Vanzetti? A trifling
number, as will appear in this analysis; while a very much
larger number of those who saw the crime are positive that
neither Sacco nor Vanzetti were the bandits.</p>

<p class='c007'>Several important witnesses for the prosecution were
seriously discredited, while various responsible persons who saw
the events connected with the crime and who declared that the
arrested men were not the bandits, were pushed aside by the
state after it interviewed them.</p>

<p class='c007'>Here follows a careful analysis of the actual testimony for
Sacco and Vanzetti. This analysis is the result of a searching
study of the 3,900 pages of official transcript. Every statement
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>set down here, unless otherwise specified, is borne out by the
court record.</p>

<p class='c007'>The mass of evidence which went toward the setting of the
crime but which had no bearing on the guilt or innocence of the
accused is eliminated, while evidence introduced piecemeal and
in haphazard order is assembled and arranged under appropriate
heads.</p>

<p class='c007'>The testimony relating only to Vanzetti is presented first
because it is the shorter and thus more easily disentangled from
the mass of detail under which its inadequacy was hidden.
Such an arrangement throws into bold relief the injustice of
the court’s refusal to separate the trials of the two men. A
request for the separation was entered by the defense at the
opening and again at the close of the trial. “Where is there
anything prejudicial to Vanzetti,” asked the judge, “if proper
instructions are given to the jury?” But juries, despite formal
instruction to count this fact against Defendant No. 1 and that
fact against Defendant No. 2, inevitably tend to count all facts
against both when they are tried together. The human mind
is not a mechanical instrument which functions according to
judicial instructions.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then the case against Sacco is treated in full, and finally
the evidence applicable to both men is analyzed.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>TESTIMONY RELATING ONLY TO VANZETTI</h3>

<p class='c018'>In weighing the testimony against Vanzetti, it should be
borne in mind that the prosecution admitted it had no evidence
that Vanzetti took any part in the shooting. He was never
given a preliminary examination on the South Braintree crime
and did not know on what ground he would be linked with that
crime until he heard it at the trial.</p>

<p class='c007'>The prosecution sought to connect him with the murder by
producing one witness—solitary, uncorroborated and conceded
by the prosecution to be “mistaken” in one part of his observations—who
claimed fourteen months after the event, to “identify”
Vanzetti as among the bandits; two detached witnesses who
claimed to have seen him on the morning of the crime in or near
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>Braintree; one other who claims to have seen him in the bandit-car
some miles distant after the crime; one witness who claimed
to have seen him in a trolley car in another town on the evening
before or following the crime, and by an attempt to show that a
revolver found in Vanzetti’s possession belonged to Berardelli,
one of the men murdered, but this fizzled completely.</p>

<p class='c007'>The defense countered by introducing impeaching evidence
of all the so-called “identifications” and by bringing strong alibi
witnesses.</p>

<p class='c007'>Of the score of witnesses for both sides who described some
portion of the murder scene, 35 claimed to have gotten a
sufficiently good view to describe the face of one or more of the
bandits. The only one of these who identified Vanzetti was
Michael Levangie, gate tender for the N. Y., N. H. &#38; H. railroad
at South Braintree. This man was in his shanty on the west
side of the tracks when the shooting occurred. He had lowered
the gates for an oncoming train; then he saw an automobile
coming from the east.</p>

<p class='c007'>In that car sitting beside the driver, Levangie said, a man
waved a revolver at him, motioning him to raise the gates, and
the car sped across. The man with the pistol snapped the
trigger at the gateman as the automobile passed. Levangie
declared the driver was dark complexioned, with black hair,
heavy brown moustache, cheek-bones sticking out, slouch hat,
army coat. He identified the driver as Vanzetti.</p>

<p class='c007'>The District Attorney in his closing argument admitted that
Vanzetti could not have been at the wheel, as the testimony was
overwhelming that the driver was a light, consumptive looking
man. The defense brought four witnesses who absolutely impeached
Levangie’s assertions in toto:</p>

<p class='c007'>Henry McCarthy, fireman on the New Haven, talked with
Levangie a few minutes after the shooting. Levangie told him
he didn’t get a look at the bandits, and was so scared he ran for
cover. McCarthy volunteered to testify for the defense after
reading Levangie’s assertions in the newspapers.</p>

<p class='c007'>Edward Carter, shoe-worker for Slater and Morrill, testified
that Levangie told him at 4:15 P. M. that day, the driver was
light-complexioned.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>Alexander Victorson, a freight clerk at South Braintree,
heard Levangie say immediately after the shooting, “it would be
hard to identify those men.”</p>

<p class='c007'>John L. Sullivan, gate tender who takes shifts with Levangie,
was told by Levangie, about two weeks before the trial that he
had been interviewed by J. J. McAnarney, counsel for the defense,
and that he had told him he was unable to identify anyone.
Under cross-examination, Levangie first acknowledged that he
remembered this interview. Later he declared, “I don’t
remember anything about it,” and denied having ever told anyone
that he was unable to identify the bandits. Asked if he had ever
described the driver as a “light-complexioned, Swedish or
Norwegian type of person,” he answered, “No, sir.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Levangie was a loose-jointed fellow, with a shifty eye and
a look of cunning in his face. He appeared wholly unabashed at
the contradictions brought out during his cross-examination.
Rather he had the manner of regarding the whole proceedings
as a joke. It would be difficult to imagine a witness less entitled
to carry weight. Yet his “identification” was the sole evidence
of Vanzetti’s presence at the murder scene.</p>

<p class='c007'>The other identification witnesses of Vanzetti referred to
times and places other than those of the crime. They were
Faulkner, Dolbeare, Reed, and by a stretch of liberality also
Cole.</p>

<p class='c007'>John W. Faulkner averred that he left Cohasset on the 9:23
a. m. train on April 15. At three stations he was asked by a
man across the aisle if this was East Braintree. The inquirer
said that a man behind him wanted to know. Faulkner identified
Vanzetti as the man in back. This man alighted at East
Braintree.</p>

<p class='c007'>The improbability that any man on his way to commit
murder should attract attention to himself and to the point at
which he was to meet his companions in crime, is heightened if
applied to Vanzetti who is a man of superior intelligence and
who had made frequent journeys on that railroad line.</p>

<p class='c007'>The morning after the murder, when the news of the crime
was published, it occurred to Faulkner that perhaps the Italian
on the train might be mixed up with the affair. Then came the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>arrest and the publication of Sacco’s and Vanzetti’s pictures.
But Faulkner, with the episode fresh in his mind, did nothing.
Two months later he was taken to make an identification. At
Dedham he testified positively, “He is the man,” indicating
Vanzetti in the cage opposite to him.</p>

<p class='c007'>At one point defense counsel McAnarney suddenly requested
a certain man in the audience to step forward, a dark man with
a big moustache like Vanzetti’s, and Faulkner was asked:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Isn’t this the man you saw on the train?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I don’t know. He might be.”</p>

<p class='c007'>But the dark man bore little resemblance to Vanzetti, except
for the big moustache. His name, Joseph Scavitto.</p>

<p class='c007'>In contradiction of Faulkner’s claim, the defense put on the
stand the conductor of the train, who certified that no ticket had
been collected from Plymouth to East Braintree or to Braintree
on that day, and that no cash fare had been paid; and it put on
the stand the ticket agents of Plymouth, of Seaside, first station
out of Plymouth, and Kingston, the second station out of
Plymouth, all of whom testified that no ticket had been sold to
either of the above points.</p>

<p class='c007'>While the jury was being drawn, Harry Dolbeare, piano
tuner from South Braintree, was excused from service after a
whispered conversation with the judge. Summoned later as a
prosecution witness, he testified that he asked to be excused because
he recognized Vanzetti in court as a man he saw in South
Braintree on April 15, <i>fourteen months before he testified</i>.</p>

<p class='c007'>Dolbeare asserted that on that uneventful morning he saw
an automobile moving along the street with five men in it, and
he noticed particularly the middle man of the three in the rear
seat. This man was leaning forward talking with somebody in
the front. Dolbeare got only a profile view of him against the
background of the black curtain.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What was it about them that attracted your attention?”
asked Attorney McAnarney.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The appearance of the whole five attracted me. They
were strangers to me, and appeared to be foreigners.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What else?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, that carload was a tough-looking bunch.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>Dolbeare agreed that he had seen many cars containing
three, five or seven foreigners coming from the Fore River
shipyards.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Give me some description of the men on the front seat,”
said McAnarney.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I wouldn’t like to be on record, for my impression isn’t
firm enough. The men on the front seat impressed me hardly
any.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He thought they wore old clothes, but he didn’t know
whether they wore overalls and jumpers, nor whether they were
clean or grimy.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Give me some description of the other men on the back
seat,” demanded McAnarney.</p>

<p class='c007'>But Dolbeare couldn’t give a single detail except that they
were a “tough-looking bunch.” All the excitement attendant
upon the murders in Braintree that day didn’t impel him to
inform the authorities that he had seen a tough-looking bunch in
an automobile, nor did he go to Brockton police station with the
big delegation which went from Braintree after Sacco and Vanzetti
were arrested. Even the photographs of Vanzetti published
broadcast then did not move him to any action.</p>

<p class='c007'>At 4:15 P. M. on the crime-date, Austin T. Reed, gate tender
at the Matfield Crossing, some miles distant from South
Braintree put the gates down for a passing train and brought a
big touring car to a stand. “A dark complexioned man” with
“kind of hollow cheeks, high cheek bones—stubbed moustache”
wearing a slouch hat, called out in “clear and unmistakable”
English, “What in hell are you holding us up for?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Three weeks later, when Sacco and Vanzetti had been
arrested and many persons were being taken to the Brockton
jail to look them over, Reed went to Brockton, “looked for an
Italian,” as he testified under cross-examination, an Italian with
a moustache, and Vanzetti filled the bill. He recognized not only
the appearance, but the voice, which speaking in the jail in a
conversational tone and in Italian, recalled to the witness “that
same gruff voice” in which the Italian had hollered at him from
the automobile. This witness was certain of his “identification,”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>although Vanzetti’s moustache is the opposite of “stubbed” and
his accent is noticeably foreign.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is to be noted that Reed placed the moustached man with
whom he “identified” Vanzetti, on the front seat beside the
driver, the location in which almost every other witness had
placed the bandit with whom it was sought to identify Sacco.</p>

<p class='c007'>One other witness, Austin C. Cole, conductor on the trolley
car into Brockton on which Sacco and Vanzetti were arrested
on the evening of May 5th following the crime, testified that
these same men had ridden on his car at the same hour on either
April 14th or 15th. If this testimony is accepted as to the 14th,
it discredits Faulkner’s testimony as to the passenger on the
train from Cohasset the following morning. And if it is
accepted as to the 15th, then it claims that two red-handed
murderers, one of whom had been in the limelight before scores
of spectators, left their high power automobile to board a trolley
several hours later in a town not far from the scene of their
crime.</p>

<p class='c007'>Under cross-examination Cole admitted that when the two
men boarded the car in April he thought at first the larger man
was “Tony the Portuguese,” whom he had known in Campello
for a dozen years.</p>

<p class='c007'>Defense Counsel McAnarney showed Cole a profile
photograph of a man with a large dark moustache.</p>

<p class='c007'>Q. Do you recognize that picture?</p>

<p class='c007'>A. It looks like Vanzetti. (Cole, of course was sitting
where he could see Vanzetti plainly as he answered.)</p>

<p class='c007'>Q. That is a picture of Vanzetti?</p>

<p class='c007'>A. That is what I would call it.</p>

<p class='c007'>Q. And not a picture of your friend Tony? A. No.</p>

<p class='c007'>At this juncture a man was brought into the courtroom.</p>

<p class='c007'>Q. Do you know this man? A. I have met him, yes.</p>

<p class='c007'>Q. Who is he? A. Tony.</p>

<p class='c007'>McAnarney showed the picture to Cole again.</p>

<p class='c007'>Q. Is that a picture of Vanzetti?</p>

<p class='c007'>A. It looks like it.</p>

<p class='c007'>But actually it was a photograph of another Italian, wholly
unlike Vanzetti except that he has a big moustache.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>The foregoing is the whole case against Vanzetti in the
way of identification.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was the theory of the government that the Harrison &#38;
Richardson revolver which Vanzetti carried when arrested had
been taken from Berardelli’s dead body by the bandit who shot
him. No one had seen this done. Prosecutor Katzmann based
the theory on evidence that Berardelli was known to have carried
a revolver (whether of similar make is unknown), which had
been seen in Berardelli’s possession and handled by a prosecution
witness, James F. Bostock, the Saturday previous to the
shooting, and that no weapon was found on Berardelli after his
death.</p>

<p class='c007'>Three weeks before the murders, however, Berardelli took
his revolver to the Iver Johnson Company in Boston for repairs,
according to testimony given by his widow, Mrs. Sarah Berardelli.
She accompanied him on the trip. The gun had a broken
spring.</p>

<p class='c007'>Berardelli had obtained the revolver originally from his
superior, Parmenter, and he gave the repair check to Parmenter
so that the latter could take the gun out after it was repaired,
the widow stated. “I don’t know whether the revolver ever
came back.... Mr. Parmenter let him have another revolver,
with a black handle like the first.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Mrs. Berardelli did not identify the Vanzetti revolver as her
husband’s.</p>

<p class='c007'>Lincoln Wadsworth, in charge of gun repairing at the Iver
Johnson Company, testified that the company’s records show that
Berardelli brought in a 38-calibre Harrington and Richardson
revolver for repairs on March 20. But Geo. Fitzmeyer, gunsmith
for that firm, testified that a revolver on Repair Job No. 94765
was a 32-calibre gun. The company’s records, according to the
testimony of James H. Jones, manager of the firearms department,
do not show whether the revolver repaired on Job No.
94765 was ever delivered.</p>

<p class='c007'>When Fitzmeyer was testifying, he was asked to examine
the Vanzetti pistol, and he declared that a new hammer had
recently been put into that gun. But he found no indications
that any new spring had lately been put into it.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>Of important, almost conclusive, bearing upon the state
theory is the testimony of Mrs. Aldeah Florence, the friend with
whom Mrs. Berardelli made her home after her husband’s death.
She testified that the day following the funeral, while in
conversation with the widow she had lamented “Oh, dear, if he had
taken my advice and taken the revolver out of the shop, maybe
he wouldn’t be in the same condition he is today.” The government
might have called Mrs. Berardelli to the witness stand to
contradict this evidence had it believed it to be untrue, but did
not do so. If Mrs. Florence’s testimony stands, and the
government did not challenge it, then the rest of the voluminous
testimony relative to the pistol is irrelevant.</p>

<p class='c007'>Vanzetti’s gun was traced from owner to owner until no
doubt remained as to its identity.</p>

<p class='c007'>If the evidence against Vanzetti was slight, there was
nevertheless the fact, never referred to, but in everybody’s mind,
which cannot fail to have been counted as evidence, that upon his
arrest he had been at first charged, not with complicity in the
South Braintree crime, but as principal in the attempted holdup
at Bridgewater.</p>

<p class='c007'>Under the forms of legal procedure, there was no chance
to put in the plea that the earlier trial for the Bridgewater crime
was believed by those who had studied the transcript of evidence
to have been an almost grotesque travesty of justice. The
Bridgewater crime stalked behind and overshadowed all the
evidence introduced against Vanzetti at Dedham.</p>

<p class='c007'>The failure on the part of Judge Webster Thayer to separate
the two trials made it inevitable that this shadow (and no
amount of instructions could remove it) also covered Sacco.</p>

<p class='c007'>Bartolomeo Vanzetti declared on the witness stand that he
was in Plymouth, 35 miles from South Braintree all day on
April 15. He gave names of persons to whom he sold fish; told
of buying a piece of suiting from Joseph Rosen, a woolen
peddler; and of talking with Melvin Corl, a fisherman, while
Corl was painting a boat by the sea.</p>

<p class='c007'>Vanzetti’s alibi was supported by eleven undiscredited
witnesses.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mrs. Alphonsine Brini testified that Vanzetti brought fish
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>to her home in Cherry Court, Plymouth, about 10 a. m. April 15.
He came back about noon with Rosen, and asked her to examine
and pass upon the quality of cloth he had bought for a suit.
Mrs. Brini fixed the date by the fact that she had been home a
week from the hospital, and that her husband telephoned that
day to Dr. Shurtleff for a nurse.</p>

<p class='c007'>Miss Lefevre Brini, 15, stated that Vanzetti delivered fish
at the Brini home about 10 o’clock on April 15. She had
remained home from work that day to care for her mother, who
was ill.</p>

<p class='c007'>Miss Gertrude Mathews, nurse in medical department of
Plymouth Cordage Company, recalled telephone conversation
with Dr. Shurtleff regarding the matter of attending Mrs. Brini.
Was at Brini home to attend her from April 15 to April 20,
inclusive.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mrs. Ella Urquhart, another nurse at the cordage plant,
recalled the same message from Dr. Shurtleff.</p>

<p class='c007'>Joseph Rosen, woolen peddler, testified that he met Vanzetti
in Suosso’s Lane, Plymouth, shortly before noon on April 15.
Vanzetti was pushing his fish-cart. They were acquainted.
Rosen had sold him cloth before. Sold him a piece of suiting
now with a hole in it, “at a bargain”; went with Vanzetti to
Brini home to show goods to Mrs. Brini.</p>

<p class='c007'>Several other persons in Plymouth bought cloth from him
that day, Rosen averred. Rosen was actually one of the
strongest witnesses in Vanzetti’s defense. The prosecution never
attempted to disprove his story of his presence in Plymouth on
the day of the crime. If that story had not been true, it would
have been easy for the commonwealth to have discredited Rosen
by producing the various persons to whom he said he made sales.
One of these was the wife of the police chief of Plymouth.</p>

<p class='c007'>But the prosecution did not produce any of these persons as
witnesses, and Rosen’s story stands unshaken in every detail.</p>

<p class='c007'>That evening Rosen went by train to Whitman, a small
town near Brockton. There he read in the Brockton papers
about the payroll murders at South Braintree, and he heard
many people there talking about the crime. He stayed that night
at a small hotel in Whitman. Next day he returned to Boston.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>Three weeks later he read of the arrest of Sacco and Vanzetti.
Remembering Vanzetti well, he fixed the date by his memory
that when he had reached Whitman, all the town was talking
about the South Braintree murders.</p>

<p class='c007'>He also fixed that date as April 15 with reference to a
receipt for taxes, paid by his wife on that date, and about which
he had spoken to her before leaving home. The receipt was
produced in court.</p>

<p class='c007'>Miss Lillian Schuler, waitress in hotel at Whitman, testified
that she rented a room to a man on the night of April 15.
Register simply shows that a man occupied the room, and gives
no name.</p>

<p class='c007'>Melvin Corl, Plymouth fisherman, testified that he was
painting a boat on the afternoon of April 15. Vanzetti came
down to the shore and talked with him for an hour. Corl fixed
the date by reference to his wife’s birthday which fell on April
17th, on which date he launched the boat and made a trip to
Duxbury to tow a boat back, for which he received $5.00.</p>

<p class='c007'>Angelo Giadobone of Plymouth bought fish of  Vanzetti on
April 15. Remembered date with relation to April 19, when he
was operated on for appendicitis. Giadobone said he still owed
Vanzetti for the fish.</p>

<p class='c007'>Antonio Carbone of Plymouth attested that he sold fish to
Vanzetti on April 15.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>TESTIMONY RELATING ONLY TO SACCO</h3>

<p class='c018'>The government sought to establish Sacco as the dark man
“needing a shave” who leaned against the fence below the Rice &#38;
Hutchins factory, shot Berardelli, jumped into the automobile and
leaning out shot right and left as the car fled through the town.
Towards that end, it brought into court four alleged eyewitnesses
of the crime and escape who “identified” Sacco. These
four were Miss Splaine, Miss Devlin, Pelser and Goodridge. Two
others called for the same purpose, Wade and De Berardinis,
disappointed the prosecution by their failure to identify.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mary Eva Splaine, bookkeeper for Slater and Morrill, gave
a remarkably complete description of one of the bandits in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>fleeing car, considering that she was in a second-story window
a minimum distance of 80 feet from the car, and saw the bandit
only in the brief time required for an automobile to travel 35
feet at 18 miles an hour—which is one and one-fifth seconds.
She saw the car first from an east window; then switched to a
window facing south. As she stepped to the south window, a
man leaned out from behind the front seat.</p>

<p class='c007'>“He was slightly taller than I,” she testified; “weighed about
140 to 145 pounds, had dark hair, dark eyebrows, thin cheeks,
and clean-shaven face of a peculiar greenish-white. His forehead
was high. His hair was brushed back, and it was, I should
think, between two and two and a half inches long. His shoulders
were straight out, square. He wore no hat.... His face was
clear-cut, clean-cut. He wore a gray shirt. He was a muscular,
active looking man, and had a strong left hand, a powerful
hand.”</p>

<p class='c007'>She said he was leaning half out of the car, just behind the
front seat, and that his left hand was on the back of that seat,
presumably at arm’s length from his face.</p>

<p class='c007'>“He was in my view from the middle of the distance
between the railroad tracks and the cobbler shop, a distance
probably 60 to 70 feet, and half distance would be 30 to 35 feet.
My view was cut off by the cobbler shop.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Miss Splaine declared positively that Sacco was the bandit
who leaned from the car. Defense Counsel Fred H. Moore
confronted her with the record of the preliminary hearing in
the Sacco case, which shows that at that time, a year before the
trial and a few weeks after the crime and after she had looked
Sacco over to her complete satisfaction on three different days,
she admitted under oath that she “could not swear positively
that Sacco was the bandit.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That is not true,” she now asserted. “I never said it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>But next day she came into court and announced that she
wished to change her testimony, and admitted she had said at
the preliminary hearing that she could not swear positively
Sacco was the bandit. (Page 416, official transcript.) She
added that her present certainty of Sacco’s being the bandit
came from “reflection.” The transcript of the preliminary
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>testimony (Page 56) showed that she had said in police court:
“I do not think my opportunity afforded me the right to say he
is the man.”</p>

<p class='c007'>In the preliminary hearing she remembered a revolver in
the right hand. At the trial she recalled nothing about the right
hand or this revolver.</p>

<p class='c007'>Finally she admitted that when she visited state police
headquarters in Boston shortly after the crime, she was shown
a rogues’ gallery photograph of a certain man. Of him she
said: “He bears a striking resemblance to the bandit.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Later she learned that this man was in Sing Sing prison on
April 15.</p>

<p class='c007'>Frances J. Devlin, also a bookkeeper for Slater and Morrill,
gave testimony similar to that of Miss Splaine. She saw the
escaping car from the same observation point, a window in the
second story of the Hampton House, at least 80 feet from the
car. She said she saw a man in the right rear seat of the
automobile lean out and fire at the crowd.</p>

<p class='c007'>This bandit, she said, was fairly thick-set, dark, pale, rather
good looking, with clear features. His hair grew away from his
temples, and was blown back. She “positively identified” Sacco
as the bandit.</p>

<p class='c007'>Under cross-examination Miss Devlin admitted she had
testified in the preliminary hearing that the bandit was tall and
well-built, while Sacco is only 5 feet 6 inches tall. She admitted
she said then: “I don’t say positively he is the man.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The Quincy police court record shows she said at the
preliminary hearing that she got a better view of the chauffeur’s
face than of the other bandit’s. This was manifestly impossible
as the car was covered and had a left hand drive. But at the
trial she declared that she never said that; and now said that
she did not see the chauffeur’s face.</p>

<p class='c007'>She admitted that Sacco was made to assume postures like
that of the bandit for her in Brockton police station.</p>

<p class='c007'>Answering questions by Prosecutor Harold Williams, Miss
Devlin explained she had testified in the lower court that she
couldn’t say positively that Sacco was the bandit “because of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>immensity of the crime. I felt sure in my own mind, but I
hated to say so, out and out.”</p>

<p class='c007'>In spite of the seemingly impossible detail of the descriptions
of these two young women, considering their position and the
extreme brevity of the period of observation, in spite of the
manner in which doubt at the preliminary hearings changed into
certainty in the final trial, they were the strongest witnesses
against Sacco.</p>

<p class='c007'>The third of these witnesses, Louis Pelser, went to pieces
on the stand. He was a shoe-cutter in the Rice and Hutchins
factory, working on the first floor above the raised basement.
Pelser asserted that through the crack of an opened window he
saw a man sinking on the pavement, that he opened a window,
and that he stood up amid flying bullets and did two things—he
wrote down the number of the approaching bandit-automobile
and he made a mental note of one bandit who was shooting at
the fallen Berardelli. This witness declared that he noticed
even the pin in the bandit’s collar.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I wouldn’t say it was him,” Pelser said, “but Sacco is a
dead image of him.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Then Pelser proceeded to tangle himself up in lie after lie.
He admitted he had lied to Robert Reid, defense investigator,
“to avoid being a witness,” and that he had told Reid he didn’t
see anything because he got scared and ducked under a bench.
Next he denied ever discussing the case with any one previous
to Reid’s interview with him, but later admitted he had talked
with a state detective previous to that time.</p>

<p class='c007'>Cross examination revealed that Pelser had been out of
work for some time after the tragedy, and had been re-employed
by Rice and Hutchins two months before the trial. Subsequently
he told his foreman he had testimony to give. On the morning
of the day Pelser appeared in court, he talked with Prosecutor
Williams, was shown Sacco’s picture and was taken to identify
him. Fourteen months had elapsed between the crime-date and
the day on which Pelser purported to identify Sacco on the
witness stand at Dedham.</p>

<p class='c007'>Pelser was noticeably embarrassed on the stand, mopping
his forehead continually, shifting his weight from foot to foot,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>and unable to understand the simplest questions. Further his
testimony was contradicted by three fellow workers:</p>

<p class='c007'>William Brenner declared it was he and not Pelser whose
station was near the partly open window, and that it was
McCollum who opened the window fully. He said that McCollum
shouted: “They are shooting; duck!” and that they all dropped
down behind the bench. When the shots sounded farther away,
they got up again, looked out, somebody got the automobile
number and wrote it on the work-bench. By that time the car
was near the railroad tracks.</p>

<p class='c007'>Peter McCollum declared that it was he and not Pelser who
threw open the window and shut it again instantly, then dropped
down behind the work-bench with his fellows. He was the only
one who looked out of the open window during the shooting, he
swore. Opaque glass was in all the windows in the work room.</p>

<p class='c007'>Dominic Costantino confirmed Brenner’s and McCollum’s
testimony. He saw Pelser get under the bench along with the
rest. He heard him say afterward that he didn’t see anyone.
He volunteered as a witness after reading Pelser’s testimony in
the Globe.</p>

<p class='c007'>The last of the crime-scene witnesses against Sacco, Carlos
E. Goodridge, is a phonograph salesman. He testified that he
was in a poolroom on Pearl street a few doors west of the
Hampton House. He heard shots, stepped out, saw the bandit-automobile
coming; when it was 20 or 25 feet away a man
pointed a gun at him; he went back into the poolroom. Man
with gun was dark, smooth-shaven, bareheaded, pointed face,
dark suit. Goodridge identified Sacco as that man.</p>

<p class='c007'>Four witnesses including the proprietor of the poolroom
gave the lie to this witness:</p>

<p class='c007'>Peter Magazu, the poolroom proprietor, declared that when
Goodridge came back into the poolroom he said the bandit he
saw was light-haired; and he had said: “This job wasn’t pulled
by any foreign people.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Harry Arrigoni, barber, related that Goodridge said a week
after the shooting that he couldn’t identify any of the bandits.</p>

<p class='c007'>Nicola D’Amato, another barber, said Goodridge told him on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>April 15 he was in the poolroom when the bandit-car passed and
did not see anybody in the automobile.</p>

<p class='c007'>Andrew Mangano, music store owner and former employer
of Goodridge, testified that he had urged him to go to see if he
could identify the suspects in jail, and that Goodridge told him
it was useless; he couldn’t identify the bandits. Mangano
declared that Goodridge’s reputation for truth and veracity was
bad.</p>

<p class='c007'>With the jury absent, the defense endeavored to introduce
testimony to show that when Goodridge first identified Sacco in
September, 1920 (when Vanzetti was in this same courtroom
in Dedham for a hearing), Goodridge was in court to answer a
charge of absconding with funds belonging to his employer.
Judge Thayer barred that evidence on the ground that no final
judgment was entered in the Goodridge case. Goodridge simply
pleaded guilty to the theft, and the case was “filed.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Lewis L. Wade was a disappointment to the prosecution, as
he was one of those upon whose testimony the indictment of
Sacco was based. He was an employee of Slater and Morrill, and
was in the street when the crime occurred, saw Berardelli shot
from a distance of 72 paces. Just then a car came up; the man
at the wheel was pale, 30 to 35 years old, looked sick. The
assailant threw a cash box into the car and jumped in.</p>

<p class='c007'>This man was described by Wade as short, bareheaded, 26
or 27, weighed about 140, hair blown back, needed shave, hair
cut with “feather edge” in back. Wore gray shirt.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Have you seen the man who shot Berardelli since?” asked
Prosecutor Williams.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I thought I saw him in Brockton police station,” Wade
answered. “I thought then it was Sacco.”</p>

<p class='c007'>But Wade declared now that he wasn’t sure. He had felt
“a little mite of doubt” when he had testified in the preliminary
hearing at Quincy. “I might be mistaken,” he had then testified.
His doubt deepened about four weeks before he took the witness
stand. “I was in a barber shop, and a man came in. His face
looked familiar. The more I looked at that man and the more
I thought about him the more I thought he resembled the man
who killed Berardelli.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>Another heavy setback awaited the prosecution in the
testimony of Louis De Berardinis, cobbler, who it was claimed
had “identified” at Brockton. His shop is on Pearl Street with
the Hampton building behind, a grass plot being between. He
heard shots, ran out of shop, saw bandit-car coming across
tracks, man jumping in. Man leaned out of the car with gun in
hand, came opposite, pointed gun at him, pulled trigger; no
explosion.</p>

<p class='c007'>“That bandit was pale, had a long face, awful white,” said De
Berardinis, “and he had light hair. A thin fellow, light weight.
Not like Sacco. The one I saw was light. Sacco is dark.”</p>

<p class='c007'>This is the complete identification case against Sacco so far
as the murder scene is concerned. As has been shown, Pelser
is discredited by his self-contradictions on the stand, and both
his testimony and Goodridge’s is refuted by several undiscredited
witnesses. The two bookkeepers were at a disadvantage in their
location for purposes of identification, and they were positive
fourteen months after the crime, whereas only a few weeks after
it, they had expressed some uncertainty.</p>

<p class='c007'>In addition to the above six, the government put five
witnesses on the stand who got a sufficiently good view of bandit
with whom it was sought to identify Sacco to describe his
appearance; namely, Carrigan, Bostock, McGlone, Langlois, and
Behrsin. None of them were able to make an identification. It
is of prime importance that their locations were such as to make
their testimony applicable to the same bandit whom the four
“positive witnesses” identify as Sacco.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mark E. Carrigan, shoe-worker employed by Slater and
Morrill on the third floor of the Hampton House related that he
saw Parmenter and Berardelli proceeding from the offices to the
main factory with the payroll money, and that he presently heard
shooting and saw the bandit-automobile coming east on Pearl
street past the Hampton House. He saw a dark Italian-looking
man in the car with a revolver.</p>

<p class='c007'>But he could not identify either defendant as being in that
car. Carrigan’s testimony has a large bearing upon the credibility
of Miss Splaine and Miss Devlin, who from a window one
floor below where Carrigan was, claimed to identify Sacco as a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>man who was leaning out of the escaping automobile. Eight
feet below Carrigan, the two women were no more than a foot
closer to the bandits than he.</p>

<p class='c007'>James F. Bostock, machine installer of Brockton, had been
doing work for Slater and Morrill. Shortly before the shooting,
he came out of the Slater factory and walked west on Pearl
street. He passed two men, who were leaning against a fence
arguing. It is not disputed that one of these was the man who
shot Berardelli.</p>

<p class='c007'>Immediately afterward he met Parmenter and Berardelli
coming down the road with the payroll boxes. Bostock was a
close friend of Parmenter. They exchanged words in a momentary
meeting. Just after Bostock had left the paymaster, he
heard shots, turned, and saw Parmenter and Berardelli fall.
The men he had seen at the fence were shooting. They grabbed
the money-boxes and jumped into an oncoming automobile.</p>

<p class='c007'>Bostock ran around the corner of a high board fence along
the New Haven track. The bandit-car passed so close, he said,
that he could have touched it with his hand.</p>

<p class='c007'>He said he could not identify either of the defendants as the
highwaymen.</p>

<p class='c007'>James E. McGlone, teamster, helped lower Parmenter to the
ground after the fatal shot. McGlone had been working in the
excavation. When the shooting started he ran forward, and saw
the bandits at close range. The commonwealth didn’t ask him
if he could identify. Defendants’ counsel had not interviewed
him. They asked him in court if he could identify the defendants,
and he said he could not.</p>

<p class='c007'>Edgar C. Langlois, foreman of Rice and Hutchins, was on
the second floor (from the street level) of that factory, facing
on the crime-scene. He could make no identification. The only
description he could give was that the highwaymen he saw were
“stout, thick-chested—that is, full-chested,” a description which
fits neither Sacco nor Vanzetti.</p>

<p class='c007'>Langlois’ testimony is highly significant because he was in
a central window immediately above the window from which
another prosecution witness, Pelser, claimed he observed Sacco.
This witness occupies a responsible position in Rice and Hutchins.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>Hans Behrsin, chauffeur for Mr. Slater of the robbed shoe
company, testified for the prosecution. He was sitting in a
stationary sedan on the right-hand side of Pearl street, a little
beyond the poolroom.</p>

<p class='c007'>Five men were in the automobile, Behrsin said. They
passed him within ten feet. One man was leaning out. The car
was going 16 to 18 miles an hour. He could not identify either
defendant as being one of the bandits. A few moments earlier
he had noticed the two bandits just before they opened fire, and
he described them as light-complexioned.</p>

<p class='c007'>The government contends further that the bandits had
lingered about South Braintree during the morning. Precisely
as against Vanzetti, three witnesses uncorroborated—unless
impeachment be an inverted kind of corroboration—were brought
forward in support of the contention that Sacco had been seen
in the town that morning.</p>

<p class='c007'>William S. Tracy, elderly real estate dealer, testified that
about 11:45 he saw two men leaning against the window of a
drugstore building he owned. They were “clean-shaven, smoothfaced,
respectably dressed.” He entered the drug store, came
out, and drove away in his automobile. Returning a few minutes
later, he found the men still there, talking. Again he went
away and again he came back, and they still were propped
against the window.</p>

<p class='c007'>Tracy identified Sacco as one of these men: “I would not
be positive,” he said, “but to the best of my recollection he is the
same man.”</p>

<p class='c007'>His statement that the two men were “respectably dressed”
contrasts with that of various prosecution witnesses who swore
the bandits were rough-looking and needed a shave.</p>

<p class='c007'>In cross-examination it developed that in February, 1921,
Tracy was taken to the Dedham jail and escorted through various
departments, and was shown large groups of prisoners, and that
finally he was taken over to “the pit,” where Sacco was all alone;
then he made his “identification.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Tracy’s testimony is open to wide question. He stands out
in stark isolation from the scores or even hundreds of persons
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>who must have stood upon or passed that corner in that noonhour,
for it is the principal intersection of South Braintree,
where innumerable people wait daily for electric cars.</p>

<p class='c007'>Consider, too, that this corner is only a few hundred feet
from the scene of the crime, that Sacco had worked at Rice and
Hutchins’, and was known presumably by sight to various
workers in South Braintree. The defense argues that it is
unreasonable to suppose that Sacco, had he been intending to
commit robbery and wanton murder in that town within three
hours would have lingered on that corner.</p>

<p class='c007'>William J. Heron, railroad police officer, testified that he
saw two men in the New Haven station at South Braintree on
April 15. One was 5 feet 6, the other 5 feet 11. He identified
Sacco as the smaller man. He noticed the two men he said,
“because they acted nervous and&#160;... they were smoking
cigarettes, one of them.” (Page 884, official transcript.)</p>

<p class='c007'>Q. Which one was smoking? A. The tallest one.</p>

<p class='c007'>Q. Did you pay much attention to the men when you first
came in? A. Not much, only I saw them smoking.</p>

<p class='c007'>Heron, too, said that the man he saw wore a hat and was
respectably dressed, which conflicts with descriptions of the
murderer.</p>

<p class='c007'>Neither man had any outstanding physical characteristics,
according to Heron. He admitted he didn’t see Sacco to identify
him until six weeks later.</p>

<p class='c007'>After Police Chief Stewart of Bridgewater and State
Policeman Brouillard had lined up Heron as a witness for the
prosecution, the defense sent an investigator, Robert Reid, to
interrogate Heron. He refused to give the defense any information.
When asked in cross-examination why he refused to talk
to Reid he gave a curious answer for a man who had been a
police officer six years.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Because I didn’t want to be brought into it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>This man’s testimony was attacked by the defense from the
same angle that Tracy’s story was attacked. Defense counsel
asked: Is it reasonable to suppose that Sacco, if intending to rob
and kill three hours later in that town where he had worked,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>would have lingered in places where many persons would have
opportunity to observe him?</p>

<p class='c007'>Mrs. Lola Andrews, a lady of miscellaneous avocations,
attested that on the morning of the crime-date she and Mrs.
Julia Campbell went from Quincy to South Braintree to seek
work in the shoe factories. They arrived between 11:00 and
11:30. Mrs. Andrews said that she saw an automobile in front
of the Slater and Morrill plant, and a man working around the
hood.</p>

<p class='c007'>When they came out of the Slater factory, this man was
under the car fixing something. She called him from beneath
the car, she asserted, and asked him how to get into the Rice
and Hutchins’ factory. She identified this man as Sacco.</p>

<p class='c007'>But at that moment, according to her own statements,
another man was standing near that automobile—a light-complexioned
emaciated Swedish-looking man. Mrs. Andrews’
testimony does not explain why she addressed her inquiry to the
man under the automobile instead of asking the man standing
near.</p>

<p class='c007'>While Mrs. Andrews was being cross-examined by Defense
Attorney Moore, and when he was showing her some photographs
she fainted, and was carried out. Prosecutor Katzmann left
the room, returned, scanned the faces of the audience, then
conferred in whispers with the court. Judge Thayer ordered
the courtroom doors closed, and various spectators were searched.</p>

<p class='c007'>When the witness took the stand again, she asserted that
she fainted because she saw a man in court whom she thought
was the person who assaulted her in February, 1920, in a toilet
in the Quincy lodging house where she had rooms.</p>

<p class='c007'>Her testimony was impeached by five defense witnesses.
The most important of these was Mrs. Julia Campbell, who
accompanied Mrs. Andrews to South Braintree that day, and
gave testimony directly opposite.</p>

<p class='c007'>An elderly but active woman, Mrs. Campbell had come from
Maine to testify for the defense after a state detective had told
her she needn’t go to Massachusetts to testify; that she didn’t
know anything of importance; and that it would cost too much
to have her make the trip.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>She submitted to an eyesight test in court at the hands of
District Attorney Katzmann, and proved that she was able to
distinguish objects and colors at long distance; one instance was
her specifying the color of a hat picked at random among the
audience. And she had been working in the shoe factories as
a stitcher, at a task which requires unerring vision.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Neither of us spoke to the man under the automobile,”
declared Mrs. Campbell. “Mrs. Andrews did not speak to either
man. It was I who addressed the inquiry about how to get into
the Rice and Hutchins’ factory. But I spoke to the man standing
in the rear of the car, not to the man underneath.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Why did Mrs. Andrews faint in court? Harry Kurlansky, a
Quincy tailor, testified that she told him she fainted because the
defense was digging into her past history, and that she was
afraid the lawyers would “bring out the trouble she had with
Mr. Landers.” Landers was a naval officer, Kurlansky said.</p>

<p class='c007'>She told him also, Kurlansky stated, that she couldn’t
identify the men at Braintree. The police wanted her to identify
some one in Dedham jail as one of the men she saw in Braintree,
but she couldn’t because she didn’t get a good look at the faces of
those men. Kurlansky volunteered to testify for the defense
after reading in newspapers of the “identification” she swore to
in court.</p>

<p class='c007'>Policeman George Fay of Quincy testified that he interviewed
Mrs. Andrews in February, 1920, in connection with the
alleged assault upon her. Did she suppose that attack had
anything to do with the South Braintree affair? She answered
that she could not identify the men she saw in Braintree as she
didn’t get a good look at them.</p>

<p class='c007'>Alfred La Brecque, Quincy reporter and secretary of the
Chamber of Commerce there, said she told him the same thing.</p>

<p class='c007'>Miss Lena Allen, rooming house proprietor, testified that
Mrs. Andrews’ reputation for truth and veracity was bad, and
that she would never want her in her house again.</p>

<p class='c007'>At the end of the trial the Government put Mrs. Mary
Gaines upon the stand to support the testimony of Mrs. Andrews
and to contradict that of Mrs. Campbell. Mrs. Gaines declared
that a few weeks after the crime she had heard Mrs. Andrews
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>say in Mrs. Campbell’s presence that she had spoken to the man
under the automobile, and that Mrs. Campbell did not contradict
her.</p>

<p class='c007'>Fred Loring, shoe-worker for Slater and Morrill, stated that
he found a dark brown cap near Berardelli’s body; it was
offered as an exhibit by the commonwealth. When tried on by
Sacco on the witness stand this cap seemed too small; whereas a
cap of his own, tried on immediately afterwards fitted with
nicety.</p>

<p class='c007'>The “bandit cap” was fur-lined and had ear-laps, which
accounts for its being smaller although the same size numerically
as Sacco’s. Sacco never owned a cap of this character. George
Kelley, superintendent of the Three K Factory where Sacco
worked, said the cap he had seen daily behind Sacco’s bench, as
he remembered, was a pepper-and-salt cloth, which he believed
was different from the one produced by the commonwealth. A
cap like the one described by Kelley was found in the house at
the time of Sacco’s arrest.</p>

<p class='c007'>Of the four bullets found in Berardelli’s dead body, three
were admittedly from a Savage pistol. The other one, however,
was from some other kind of revolver, the make of which is in
dispute. It is the prosecution’s contention that the leaden pellet
designated as Bullet No. 3 which inflicted the fatal wound upon
Berardelli, was from a Colt automatic found on Sacco when he
was arrested three weeks after the murders. The bullet was a
Winchester of an obsolete make.</p>

<p class='c007'>The testimony upon this point by experts put upon the stand
by both the government and the defense was voluminous and
highly technical. The disagreement was sharp.</p>

<p class='c007'>Captain Charles Van Amburgh, of the Remington Arms
Works, testified for the prosecution: “I believe the bullet was
fired from a Colt automatic pistol.... I am inclined to believe it
was fired from this Colt automatic.” He based this belief, he
said, on a mark he found on the bullet, visible only under a
microscope, and on similar marks noted on three bullets which
he had fired from the revolver. These bullets were all Winchesters
of a modern make. On three Peters bullets fired at the
same time no such marks were visible. The Peters bullet, he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>said, are a trifle smaller than Winchesters, and therefore under
less pressure. Under cross-examination, Van Amburg acknowledged
that pitting such as was present in the Sacco pistol was
generally caused by rust or fouling and that to the best of his
judgment, in the pistol before them, it was so caused.</p>

<p class='c007'>Captain William H. Proctor, head of the state police.</p>

<p class='c007'>He said that bullet No. 3 was consistent with being fired
from Sacco’s revolver. “That bullet was fired from a 32 Colt
automatic,” Proctor asserted. “It has a left twist and a .060 of
an inch groove. No other revolver except the Colt has a left
twist.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Don’t you know,” asked Defense Counsel McAnarney, “that
at least two other kinds of revolvers make a left twist marking?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, I don’t,” replied Proctor.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Do you know that the Spear and the Sauer guns both
make a left twist marking?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Proctor didn’t know. He had never seen either kind of gun,
never heard of them before. Both are German makes, it appears,
and occasionally one of them bobs up in a pawnshop.</p>

<p class='c007'>Although this witness had said he had been a gun expert in
a hundred cases, he was unable to take a Colt automatic revolver
apart in court. Proctor struggled with it vainly until his face
grew crimson, dropped it on the floor in his awkwardness, and
then the court suggested that some one else try. Another expert
took the weapon apart in a moment.</p>

<p class='c007'>“And what is the part of the gun through which the firing
pin protrudes,” asked Attorney McAnarney.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I do not know as I can tell you all the scientific parts of
the gun,” answered Proctor.</p>

<p class='c007'>Proctor said he received the Colt pistol and some 32-calibre
cartridges from another officer at Brockton police station.</p>

<p class='c007'>Q. Will you look at this envelope of cartridges and see
if you can identify them?</p>

<p class='c007'>A. That is the same envelope, and it looks like the same
amount of cartridges. I can tell by counting them.</p>

<p class='c007'>Neither revolver nor the bullets were ever impounded before
the trial. They were in the hands of police officers, and most of
the time in Captain Proctor’s possession. Prosecutor Katzmann
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>refused to permit the defense to examine any of the exhibits
until they were produced in court.</p>

<p class='c007'>To meet the testimony of Proctor and Van Amburgh, the
defense put on two gun experts of long standing—James E.
Burns, noted rifleman, champion pistol shot, and head of a
department of the United States Cartridge Company; and James
H. Fitzgerald, superintendent of the testing department of the
Colt Automatic Pistol Company. Burns declared that Bullet
No. 3 might have been fired from either a Colt or a Bayard
revolver. The latter is a Belgian gun; many have been brought
here since the war. Burns declared positively that the bullet
did not come from Sacco’s revolver. He fired 8 bullets through
it, and all came through clean and without any markings.</p>

<p class='c007'>Fitzgerald testified that Bullet No. 3 did not come from the
Sacco gun; that there was no condition existent in that gun to
cause the peculiar marking on the bullet.</p>

<p class='c007'>Expert Burns fired U. S. bullets, for the reason that, as
stated above, the “fatal” bullet was of an obsolete make, and he
had found it impossible to secure an exact duplicate in spite of
having made great effort to do so. He considered that the U. S.
bullets which he used corresponded more nearly with the “fatal”
bullet than did the newer make of Winchester used by Captain
Van Amburgh.</p>

<p class='c007'>To the minds of many who followed this gun testimony, the
claim of the government regarding a certain gun seemed farcical.
The fact that two of the bullets said to have been fired through
the so-called Sacco gun did bear microscopic marks faintly
resembling that on the “fatal bullet” seems to have carried
weight with some members of the jury; that is indicated by the
circumstance that the microscope was called for while the verdict
was under consideration. The question was so involved, the
chances of error so great, the opinion of experts so conflicting,
that it would seem as if a layman could hardly have made a
final judgment on the matter.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then came up the testimony about Sacco’s reputation.</p>

<p class='c007'>From 1910 to 1917 he worked in the Milford Shoe Factory.
The foreman during four years of this time, John J. Millick, a
responsible looking person of the English operative type, testified
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>of Sacco, “a steady workman, never lost a day.” Asked as to
his reputation as a peaceful and law-abiding citizen, he answered
“good.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Michael F. Kelley, the senior partner in the Three K Factory
at Stoughton where Sacco was employed the 18 months previous
to his arrest, and his son George Kelley, superintendent and
part owner, bore testimony as to Sacco’s character similar to
that of Mr. Millick.</p>

<p class='c007'>Both of the Kelleys gave testimony which dovetailed in with
that of others in establishing Sacco’s alibi. Late in March,
Sacco had told both Michael and George Kelley that he had
received letters from Italy announcing his mother’s death, and
that he must go home as soon as possible to see his father. With
George Kelley he had arranged to break in another man to do
his work and that he should be free to start for Italy as soon as
his place was satisfactorily filled.</p>

<p class='c007'>On Monday or Tuesday of the week of April 15th, Sacco told
George Kelley he would like a day off that week, to make a trip
to Boston and get the passport. On Wednesday, April 14th,
Sacco told him that he was well ahead of his work and would
go to Boston the following day. He was absent the following
day, Thursday, April 15th (the fateful day of the South Braintree
murder), in Boston; so Sacco claimed and so George Kelley
believed. The day following that, April 16th, Sacco was at work
at the usual hour. This day, the 15th of April, was the only
day of absence which George Kelley recalled. And he believed
he would have remembered had Sacco been absent on any other
day as his was “a one-man job,” and if “he was out, the work
was blocked.”</p>

<p class='c007'>It was not controverted that Sacco had been to Boston about
his passport at approximately the date he claimed. Whether he
had really gone to Boston on April 15th as he claimed, or to
South Braintree to commit murder as the Government claimed,
was the issue of the trial. Ten witnesses supported the alibi.
The truthfulness of their testimony was not impeached, although
efforts were made to impeach the reliability of their memory.
However, it appears that they certainly saw Sacco in various
parts of Boston some day that week. And since Thursday was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>the only day it was shown that Sacco was not at work, the
conclusion is obvious.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mrs. Sacco, when upon the witness stand, unwittingly to
herself buttressed her husband’s alibi claim. She fixed the date
he had gone for the passport by the visit she received from a
friend who had come with his wife from Milford the day her
husband was absent, and who had stayed to dinner. The friend
she said was Enrico Iacovelli whom her husband had sent for
to see Mr. Kelley and arrange to be broken into Sacco’s work.</p>

<p class='c007'>Henry Iacovelli, the shoe-worker who took Sacco’s place in
the Kelley factory, testified that he received a letter from Mr.
Kelley offering him Sacco’s job as an edge-trimmer, a highly
important function in the factory mechanism. He replied that
he could go and talk with Kelley on April 15; went to see him
that day; called at the Sacco home to see Sacco; Mrs. Sacco
informed him that her husband was in Boston arranging for
passports.</p>

<p class='c007'>The original correspondence exchanged between Kelley and
Iacovelli was introduced as evidence by the defense.</p>

<p class='c007'>Sacco declared under oath that he took the 8:56 o’clock train
from South Stoughton to Boston on April 15, to arrange for
passports to Italy. South Stoughton is 19 miles from Boston.</p>

<p class='c007'>In Boston, Sacco said, he had lunch with friends at Boni’s
restaurant in North Square, then went to the Italian consulate
to see about the passports. A photograph of his wife, his son
Dante and himself which he brought was too large for consular
purposes; there was considerable conversation about that; he
was instructed to furnish a smaller picture.</p>

<p class='c007'>On the streets he met and talked with certain persons.
Going again to North Square, he spent some time in Giordano’s
coffee-house; then went to East Boston, where he paid a bill
for groceries, and finally returned to Stoughton on a train about
4:20 p. m.</p>

<p class='c007'>Prof. Felice Guadagni, journalist and lecturer, testified that
he had lunch at Boni’s on April 15 with Sacco and Albert Bosco,
editor of <cite>La Notizia</cite>. While they ate, John D. Williams, an
advertising agent, entered and joined them. Sacco told them
about his intention to visit the consulate. They discussed the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>banquet given that day by Italians to Mr. Williams of the <cite>Boston
Transcript</cite> who had been decorated by the King of Italy for the
stand his paper had taken in the war—a memorable occasion
among Boston Italians.</p>

<p class='c007'>Later that afternoon Guadagni met Sacco again in Giordano’s
coffee-house. And after the arrest of the defendants,
Guadagni said he visited the consulate and talked with Giuseppe
Adrower, clerk there, establishing the fact that Sacco had
applied for a passport on April 15 and had been sent away
because the photograph he brought was too large.</p>

<p class='c007'>Prof. Antonio Dentamaro, Manager of the Foreign Department
of the Haymarket National Bank in Boston, testified in
court that he met Sacco in Giordano’s coffee-house on April 15,
between 2 and 3 p. m. Remembered date because he went to the
Coffee-House directly from the banquet to Mr. Williams which
he had attended.</p>

<p class='c007'>He especially remembered meeting Sacco because he had
sent a message by him to Leone Mucci, a member of the Chamber
of Deputies in Italy.</p>

<p class='c007'>They had talked about Sacco’s prospective return to Italy.
Sacco had said he had come to Boston to get his passport.</p>

<p class='c007'>Albert Bosco, editor of <cite>La Notizia</cite>, conservative Italian daily
newspaper in Boston, testified likewise as to the presence of
Sacco and the others in Boni’s on that day.</p>

<p class='c007'>Carlo Affè, East Boston grocer, testified that between 3 and
4 o’clock on April 15 he was paid by Sacco for an order of
groceries purchased at an earlier date. He exhibited a notebook
record of the transaction.</p>

<p class='c007'>Giuseppe Adrower, clerk in the Italian consulate at Boston
for 6 years, and now in Italy, testified in a deposition sworn to
before the American consul general at Rome. He identified the
photograph of Sacco, Mrs. Sacco and their son as a picture Sacco
brought to the consulate on April 15. He corroborated Sacco’s
statements regarding his difficulties over passports.</p>

<p class='c007'>Adrower remembered telling Sacco that the picture was too
large, and that he laughed with others in the consulate over the
big photograph, and his eye happened to catch the date on the
calendar while so doing. Sacco left the consulate a few minutes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>before the office was closed for the day; it is regularly open from
10 to 3. Very few persons were there that afternoon.... Adrower
went to Italy May 20, for his health, but Guadagni testified that
he talked with Adrower about Sacco and the photograph shortly
after Sacco’s arrest.</p>

<p class='c007'>One alibi witness who was brought forward late in the trial
and by the merest chance offered what would seem to be
incontrovertible evidence. It appeared that Sacco one day had
noticed a face in the audience at the courtroom which arrested
his attention. He called for Mr. McAnarney and asked him to
find out if that man was on the train coming from Boston to
Stoughton in the evening of April 15, 1920. Mr. McAnarney
called the man into the lobby and inquired. “I don’t know,”
answered the stranger, “but will see if I can find out.”</p>

<p class='c007'>It developed that he was a contractor who kept his own
time in his business books, by the hour; and from his books put
in evidence and from a check dated April 15th, and used to buy
supplies in Boston upon the date in question as well as by the
bills for these supplies, he was able to locate himself on that very
train. He did not know Sacco and had no recollection of having
ever seen him until he dropped in as a spectator at the trial. His
name is James M. Hayes; his residence and place of business,
Stoughton, Mass.</p>

<p class='c007'>The District Attorney, attempting to demolish Sacco’s alibi
in his closing argument, was silent as to the evidence offered by
Hayes.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>TESTIMONY RELATING TO BOTH—AND TO NEITHER</h3>

<p class='c018'>The discussion of the testimony against Vanzetti and against
Sacco must be supplemented with a number of other considerations.
In the first place, there were 22 persons on the stand
for the defense on the issue of identifications, who had at least
as good an opportunity to see the crime and the criminals as the
several state witnesses, and who said positively that these were
not the bandits.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the second place, 13 witnesses put on the stand by the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>prosecution for the purpose of establishing some facts of the
crime, of whom several were excellently placed to make identifications,
and certainly seemed anxious to apprehend the guilty
persons, could not identify either of the defendants.</p>

<p class='c007'>Thirdly, the government sought to bolster its testimony by
evolving a far-fetched and intangible theory of “consciousness
of guilt” at the time of arrest, which in turn brought into the
limelight the circumstances of the arrest and the defendants’
unpopular social views. There are also a number of other points
which consumed much time, clouded the issues, and really had
no bearing upon the case.</p>

<p class='c007'>Testimony contradicting that of Mary Eva Splaine and
Frances Devlin was given by Frank Burke, lecturer, who observed
the bandits escape from a much better vantage point than
either woman. He was on Pearl street near the New Haven
tracks and in the immediate path of the escaping car.</p>

<p class='c007'>He stood within ten feet of the automobile. He saw two
men in it, both dark. The bandit leaning out of the rear seat
pointed an automatic pistol at him and pulled the trigger, but
there was no explosion. Burke got a full view of the man who
the prosecution claimed was Sacco. He described him as very
full-faced—flat, and a broad, heavy jaw; needed a shave badly,
“dark complexioned, looked rather a desperate type of man.”</p>

<p class='c007'>But Burke declared that neither bandit was Sacco nor Vanzetti.
He had an unobstructed view of the car as it fled, while
the view of Miss Splaine and Miss Devlin was cut off by the
cobbler shop. From a distance of ten feet instead of 80 as in
the case of Misses Splaine and Devlin he described the man on
the right side front seat who the government claims was Sacco.</p>

<p class='c007'>Winfred Pierce and Laurence Ferguson, shoe-workers on
third floor of Hampton House, saw bandit-car escape from a
window directly above where Miss Splaine and Miss Devlin
observed the car. Pierce saw one bandit shoot at his friend,
Carl Knipps. Both described the bandit leaning out of the car
and shooting, but declared neither Sacco nor Vanzetti was that
man.</p>

<p class='c007'>Barbara Liscomb, a woman of about thirty, of good personality,
employed as a heeler, on the third floor of the Rice and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>Hutchins factory. She looked from a window directly above
the room in which Pelser worked. She had heard shots, ran to
the window; saw two men lying on the ground; a dark man with
a pistol in hand standing over Berardelli. He wheeled around
and pointed the pistol at her. She fainted, but in the instant of
observation, she declared the image of the bandit was firmly
implanted in her mind. “I shall remember that face all my life.
That man was neither of the defendants. Of that I am positive.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Mrs. Jennie Novelli, trained nurse, saw a big touring car
drive slowly up the street shortly before the murder occurred
and took particular notice of the chauffeur and the man beside
him, whom she thought at first she recognized. Asked if either
of these men were Sacco or Vanzetti she answered, “No, they
were not.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Albert Frantello, worker in Slater and Morrill plant.
Passed from one factory building to another at 2:55 p. m. Saw
two men leaning on fence in front of Rice and Hutchins factory.
Was close enough to touch them. Frantello, who is American of
Italian descent, is certain Sacco and Vanzetti are not those two
men. Was interviewed by state police officers, and was not
summoned by prosecution.</p>

<p class='c007'>One of the men whom Frantello described was the bandit
with whom it was sought to identify Sacco.</p>

<p class='c007'>Daniel J. O’Neil, 19 years old, a business school graduate,
got off the train from Boston and was sitting in a taxi-cab with
a Mr. Gilman when he heard the shooting. He got a distinct
impression of at least one of the bandits at a distance of 155 to
170 feet from the automobile. He said positively that neither
of the defendants was the man he saw.</p>

<p class='c007'>Five among 22 defense witnesses were laborers shoveling in
an excavation across the street from the shooting. They were
foreigners who had to speak through interpreters. In cross-examination
it was sought to show that they had been too scared
or too far from the scene of action to see anything. Their
testimony was not broken down, but presumably was accorded
little weight. One of them, a Spaniard by the name of Pedro
Iscorla, was 40 or 50 feet from crime-action; had gone to get
a drink of water. Says man who shot policeman (that is Berardelli)
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>was high and thin, slim. Light complexion, 5 feet 8 or 9.
Man who shot paymaster was a little shorter and dark.</p>

<p class='c007'>Emilio Falcone, was a hundred feet from crime-action. Saw
man who did shooting; he was light, tall. Not Sacco nor Vanzetti.
Henry Cerro, granite-cutter from Vermont, also worked
in excavation. Saw shooting 90 feet away. Parmenter was shot
by a light-haired man, he declared.</p>

<p class='c007'>Five other witnesses were working on the railroad some
distance from the crossing and claimed to have run up toward
the gate house in time to see the bandit-car cross the track.
Angelo Ricci, section gang foreman was put on later by the
government to show that they had not left the place where they
were at work. Under cross-examination he had exclaimed,
“What the hell, I did the best I could; when you’ve got 24 men
you can’t put a string on them. I told them to stop and if they
sneaked around the piles of dirt I couldn’t help it.” One of these
laborers, Joseph Cellucci, wearing the uniform of a sailor from
the training station at Newport News, declared he stood within
10 or 12 feet of the car, and that one of the bandits fired a shot
at him which left him deaf for 3 days. He described that man
and another sitting beside the driver; both about 20 years old.
Neither one was Sacco nor Vanzetti, he declared.</p>

<p class='c007'>Another of them, Nicola Gatti, is especially important
because he had been a neighbor of Sacco in Milford eight years
back. Had he seen him in the bandit-car he could not have
failed to remember. Said he got a good view of the two men in
front (with one of them it was sought to identify Sacco) and
one behind. Asked if either of the defendants were any of these
men, he answered, “No.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Thirteen prosecution witnesses testified to facts pertinent to
the exact moment of the murders, or in connection with the
escape—but did not identify. Of these, several could not have
been expected to make identification, but others had an excellent
view. Five of these have already been discussed under Sacco’s
case because they were in a position to see the bandit whom the
government sought to identify with Sacco. The others are
Shelley Neal, Mrs. Annie Nichols, Harris A. Colbert, Daniel
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>Buckley, Mrs. Alta Baker, F. C. Clark, John P. Lloyd, and Julia
Kelliher.</p>

<p class='c007'>Neal was an important government witness because he
attempted to identify the bandit-car with an automobile stationed
against the entrance of the express office, in the morning when
the money arrived. He claims to have seen neither Sacco nor
Vanzetti.</p>

<p class='c007'>A summary of the identification testimony for the government
and for the defense is now in place. Of 35 witnesses called,
7 were unable to make any identifications; 22 were certain that
neither Sacco nor Vanzetti were the men they had seen; 4
identified Sacco—two of them making serious changes from
former testimony, and the other two thoroughly discredited;
only one, the man whom the prosecution itself was obliged to
“interpret,” identified Vanzetti.</p>

<p class='c007'>The prosecution contended that the defendants, by their
action, attitude and utterances on the night of May 5, when they
where arrested, displayed consciousness of guilt of the South
Braintree murders.</p>

<p class='c007'>Officer Michael Connolly who arrested Sacco and Vanzetti
in a trolley car going into Brockton, asserts that as he
approached them Vanzetti put his hand in his hip pocket and
that thereupon he, Connolly, said: “You keep your hands in your
lap or you will be sorry.” Connolly further testified that a
revolver was taken off Vanzetti by Officer Vaughn, who boarded
the car at the next station, and that he, Connolly kept him
covered until he delivered him at the police station. This story
Vanzetti absolutely contradicted. With officer Connolly making
the arrest was officer Vaughn. Vaughn said he took the revolver
from Vanzetti’s right hip pocket (Transcript, p. 1280). Connolly
said it was in left (Transcript p. 1284).</p>

<p class='c007'>In the automobile which carried the arrested men to police
station, Connolly testified that Sacco twice reached his hand to
put it under his overcoat, and that he told him to keep his hand
outside his clothes and on his lap. That some conversation
about keeping hands where they belong may have taken place is
confirmed by Officer Merle A. Spear, driving the automobile, who
testified to hearing Sacco say, “You needn’t be afraid of me.”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>The government drew from this testimony a deduction of “consciousness
of guilt.” What, they ask, could have prompted men
to resist arrest, unless there was a murder on their conscience?</p>

<p class='c007'>“The consciousness of guilt” made so much of by Judge
Thayer was the consciousness of the dead body of their comrade
Salsedo lying smashed in the spring dawn two days before on
the pavement of Park Row.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c006'>XI<br> AFTER THE TRIAL</h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Since the conviction of Sacco and Vanzetti on July 14th
1921, that shocked a large part of humanity as has no legal
decision since Dreyfus was sent to Devil’s Island, the Defense
Committee, backed up by contributions from all over the United
States and from every part of the world where a labor movement
exists has managed so far to stave off the sentence. The
motion for a new trial that has just been denied was the seventh;
first under Fred H. Moore and later under William G. Thompson,
an eminent Boston attorney, president of a committee of the
Massachusetts Bar Association, who has had the courage and
sense of duty as  citizens to take up vigorously and at the risk
of loss of practice and friends an unpopular cause. It is largely
due to Mr. Thompson’s personal influence and his general
reputation for conservatism and integrity that lawyers and
ministers and college professors and newspaper readers generally
are becoming interested in the case. Now that the <cite>Boston Herald</cite>
has come out editorially for a new trial, and suggested the
appointment of an unprejudiced commission to review the whole
course of the case, there is growing, if belated, agitation in liberal
and intellectual circles. The people of Massachusetts are
beginning to get an inkling of the fact that in so grave a
miscarriage of justice there is more at stake than the lives of
two Italian radicals.</p>

<p class='c007'>The first motion for a retrial argued in October 1921 was
based on the claim that the verdict was not in accord with the
evidence. It was denied.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>Four more motions were based on newly discovered evidence.
The first charged irregularities in the jury room. The foreman
of the jury, Ripley, a former Chief of Police of Quincy, who
must have carried great weight with his fellow jurors, stated
to the defense that he had in his pockets at the trial some
cartridges of similar make and calibre to some of those in
evidence, and that there was some discussion between him and
other jurors about them. Presumably they were used for
purposes of comparison and inference. At all events such secret
evidence directly violates the conception of due process of law,
which insists that a man shall have the opportunity to subject
to the test of cross-examination all evidence offered against him.
A friend of Ripley’s also gave an affidavit to the effect that
Ripley, before the trial and knowing he was to sit on the jury,
said to him, “Damn them, (Sacco and Vanzetti), they ought to
hang them, anyway.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The motion was denied.</p>

<p class='c007'>The second motion for a new trial was based on the
testimony of Louis Pelser. Prior to the trial, according to the
defense’s affidavits, Pelser said that he witnessed the shooting of
the paymaster and his guard. He saw a wounded man sink into
the roadway, and because the bullets were firing toward the
window of the Rice &#38; Hutchins factory, where he worked, he
dropped under a bench and did not move until the bandit-car
crossed the railroad tracks 500 feet away. At least, this was his
story to an investigator for the defense.</p>

<p class='c007'>On the witness stand, however, Pelser made a positive
identification of Sacco as one of the bandits. On cross-examination
he said he had lied to the defense’s investigators. Four
months afterward he signed a long affidavit saying that his
original statement was true, that the testimony he gave at the
trial was untrue and that he gave it because he was coerced by
the District Attorney. In his affidavit he asserted that the
words: “He (Sacco) is the dead image” of the bandit were put
into his mouth by the District Attorney.</p>

<p class='c007'>Six months later Pelser recanted his recantation in a statement
to the District Attorney. This time he said his statement
to the defense’s investigator was untrue, that his trial testimony
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>was true, that the statement made after trial was untrue and
the last statement to the District Attorney true.</p>

<p class='c007'>In connection with the second motion the defense filed an
affidavit sworn to by Roy E. Gould, an itinerant vendor of razor
paste, who alleges that the bandit on the right-hand side of the
fleeing car fired at him and that a bullet went through his coat.
He was arrested by the police, but was released when he convinced
them of his innocence. He told the officers that he would be
able to identify the bandits, and gave them his name and
address. The prosecution did not call Gould. Through the
mention of his name in a newspaper article the defense, after
laborious search through half a dozen States, found him at
Portland, Me., eight months after the trial. He was confronted
with the convicted men and swore that they were not the bandits
he saw on the day of the shooting. Motion denied.</p>

<p class='c007'>The defense, in its third motion for a new trial, produced
affidavits to show that Carlos E. Goodridge, one of the prosecution’s
important witnesses, had a criminal record in several
States. At the trial Goodridge said he rushed out of a poolroom
on hearing the shots, observed the bandit-car whizzing by and
saw Sacco in the front seat, and that Sacco tried to shoot him.</p>

<p class='c007'>It so happened that some months before the trial one of the
defense counsel had been instrumental in prosecuting Goodridge
on a charge of having stolen a victrola. The news of the arrest
of Sacco and Vanzetti on May 5, 1920, was followed by the visit
to the jail of many who said they had seen the bandits.
Goodridge, the defense asserted, did not go. However, he was
taken to court to plead guilty on the same day that Sacco and
Vanzetti were taken to court. Subsequently he told the prosecution
that he recognized the two Italians and was let out on
probation.</p>

<p class='c007'>The affidavits of Goodridge’s life presented by the defense
cover 160 pages. His real name was stated to be Erastus
Corning Whitney. He is said to have been convicted in New
York of grand larceny before reaching his twentyfirst year.
After serving a three-year sentence he received his freedom and
a year later was again arrested for stealing a relative’s jewelry.
His second conviction was for a term of three years. Upon his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>release he began stealing horses. He was indicted for stealing
a horse and buggy. The affidavits signed by District Attorneys,
sheriffs, ministers and others declared that Goodridge’s
reputation for veracity was bad, that he was a petty thief, a
swindler of women, and a confidence man. Motion denied.</p>

<p class='c007'>The fourth motion for a new trial was concerned with the
testimony of Lola R. Andrews. According to the defense’s
affidavits Mrs. Andrews was interviewed by them five months
before the trial. She said she did not see Sacco, and her
description of the man she saw, according to the defense, was
not that of Sacco. “He is not the man,” she said upon seeing
photographs of Sacco. The night before she was called by the
Commonwealth she told defense counsel that she did not know
why she was being called as she could not identify anybody.</p>

<p class='c007'>Next day she made a positive identification of Sacco. Cross-examined
on the stenographic notes of her conversation with
defense counsel she said the stenographer had not transcribed
his notes honestly. She branded as a lie the statement made by
the lawyer for the defense. During her cross-examination she
fainted three times and was assisted from the room.</p>

<p class='c007'>In an affidavit sworn to by Mrs. Andrews nine months after
the trial she declared that her original statement before trial
was true, and that her trial testimony was untrue and had been
given under the coercion and intimidation of the District
Attorney’s office, which threatened to reveal her private life.</p>

<p class='c007'>(Six months later Mrs. Andrews, in a statement to the
District Attorney’s office, said that her first statement to the
defense lawyer was false, her trial testimony true, her subsequent
affidavit to the defense counsel untrue and her last statement
true). Motion denied.</p>

<p class='c007'>The fifth motion for a new trial was concerned with the
exceedingly important gun-and-bullet testimony. The Commonwealth
held that the bullet that killed Berardelli was fired from
Sacco’s pistol. Two gun experts for the defense said it was not.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Commonwealth’s experts were Captain Charles A. Van
Amburgh of the Remington Arms Works and Captain William
H. Proctor, for thirty years head of the Massachusetts State
Police.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>According to the new evidence placed before the court,
Captain Proctor states that he had the death bullet and the Sacco
pistol in his possession for more than a year before the trial and
that with Mr. Van Amburgh he conducted certain tests with
Sacco’s pistol. In his affidavit, made on Oct. 22, 1923, more
than two and a half years after the trial, Captain Proctor stated
that at the trial and at the moment of making the affidavit he
was entirely unconvinced that the mortal bullet had passed
through Sacco’s pistol. He said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“At no time was I able to find any evidence whatever which
tended to convince me that the particular mortal bullet found in
Berardelli’s body, which came from a Colt automatic pistol,
which I think was numbered 3 and had some other exhibit
number, came from Sacco’s pistol, and I so informed the
District Attorney and his assistants before the trial.</p>

<p class='c011'>“This bullet was what is commonly called a full metal patch
bullet, and, although I repeatedly talked over with Captain Van
Amburg the scratch or scratches which he claimed tended to
identify this bullet as one that must have gone through Sacco’s
pistol, his statements concerning the identifying marks seemed
to me entirely unconvincing.</p>

<p class='c011'>“At the trial the District Attorney did not ask me whether
I had found any evidence that the so-called mortal bullet, which
I have referred to as number 3, passed through Sacco’s pistol,
nor was I asked that question in cross-examination. The District
Attorney desired to ask me that question, but I had repeatedly
told him that if he did I should be obliged to answer in the
negative; consequently he put to me this question:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Q. ‘Have you an opinion as to whether bullet number 3
was fired from the Colt automatic which is in evidence?’ To
which I answered, ‘I have’.</p>

<p class='c011'>“He then proceeded, Q. ‘And what is your opinion?’ A.
‘My opinion is that it is consistent with being fired by that
pistol.’</p>

<p class='c011'>“That is still my opinion, for the reason that bullet number
3, in my judgment, passed through some Colt automatic pistol;
but I do not intend by that answer to imply that the so-called
mortal bullet had passed through this particular Colt automatic
pistol, and the District Attorney well knew that I did not so
intend, and framed his question accordingly. Had I been asked
the direct question, whether I found any affirmative evidence
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>whatever that this so-called mortal bullet had passed through
this particular Sacco’s pistol, I should have answered then, as I
do now, without hesitation, in the negative.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Frederick G. Katzmann, who was District Attorney at the
time of the trial, and Harold P. Williams, later his successor,
filed affidavits on this motion. Mr. Katzmann stated that Captain
Proctor told him that it was his opinion that the mortal
bullet had been fired from “a” Colt automatic pistol. He did
not say that it had been fired from Sacco’s pistol. Mr. Williams
said that Captain Proctor could not tell through what pistol the
mortal bullet had been fired. He also denied that Captain
Proctor’s attention had been “repeatedly” called to the question
whether he could find any evidence which would justify the
opinion that the death bullet came from the Sacco pistol.</p>

<p class='c007'>In a sense the gun-and-bullet testimony is the crux of the
case, for Judge Thayer, in his charge to the jury, said in
substance that the jurors should consider Captain Proctor’s
testimony that the death bullet passed through Sacco’s pistol.
In his summary the District Attorney said to the jury, “You
might disregard all the identification testimony and base your
verdict on the testimony of these experts.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Additional new evidence to prove that the death bullet could
not have been fired from Sacco’s pistol was furnished to the
court in the micro-photographs made by Albert H. Hamilton,
who has offered expert testimony in many murder trials in which
photographs taken under a compound microscope have been
placed in evidence.</p>

<p class='c007'>Taking the mortal bullet and test bullets fired through
Sacco’s pistol, Mr. Hamilton pointed out several markings in the
mortal bullet which he said did not appear in those that were
fired as a test. The prosecution sought to show many similarities
in the marking of both exhibits.</p>

<p class='c007'>Photographs of Mr. Hamilton showed that the shell which
the Commonwealth claimed had been fired from Sacco’s pistol
had a dent in the exact centre where the firing pin struck it. The
test shells, it was said, had dents 23 degrees off centre. The
prosecution urged that both were so nearly in the middle as to
make it certain that all had been fired from the same pistol.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>There followed the appeal to the Supreme Judicial Court in
January 1926. Despite a masterly argument by counsel for the
defense the appeal was unanimously denied.</p>

<p class='c007'>Meanwhile new evidence had been discovered, the affidavits
of Letherman and Weyand tended to prove the contention of the
defense that their radicalism had been a deciding factor in these
men’s conviction. The confession of Madeiros and the circumstantial
case erected by the defense tending to prove that the
South Braintree crime had been committed by the Morelli gang
of Providence (a case that though circumstantial seems to a
layman infinitely better founded than the state’s case against
Sacco and Vanzetti) gave the friends of Sacco and Vanzetti
fresh hope that at last a new trial would be granted. The
motions were denied.</p>

<p class='c010'>Now there is only the growing force of public opinion
between Sacco and Vanzetti and the electric chair. A new appeal
to the Supreme Judicial Court is being prepared, but it seems
hardly likely that the court will reverse its firmly-entrenched
decision. There remains the faint hope of an appeal to the
Supreme Court of the United States on the plea that the men
were convicted without due process of law.</p>

<p class='c007'>Will the people of this country and the citizens of
Massachusetts stand by and see two men murdered by the dead
weight of legal technicalities? Madeiros, murderer and gunman,
was granted a second trial, on the plea that the judge had
neglected to inform the jury that they should deem a man
innocent until he was proven guilty. It is hard for anyone not
versed in subtleties of the law to see why the same thing should
not apply to Sacco and Vanzetti. The words were probably
pronounced solemnly enough, but can anyone who has read over
the account of the trial solemnly affirm that the spirit was
there?</p>

<p class='c007'>“So you left Plymouth to dodge the draft, did you?” was
Katzmann’s first question to Vanzetti on the stand. “Did you
love your country in the last week of May, 1917? Is your love
for the United States commensurate with the amount of money
you can get in this country per week? Did you intend to condemn
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>Harvard College?” were some of the questions put to
Sacco—many of them really invitations to an argument. And
Sacco was induced, and allowed by the judge, to make a long
speech on his offensive political opinions. Katzmann’s address
to the jury ended with the words “stand together, you men of
Norfolk County!” And Judge Thayer’s charge opened as
follows: “Gentlemen of the Jury, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts
called upon you to render a most important service.
Although you knew that such service would be arduous, painful
and tiresome, yet you, like the true soldier, responded to that call
in the spirit of supreme American loyalty.” After three pages
of this, he proceeds: “Having cleared away any mist of
sympathy or prejudice from your minds and having substituted
there trust, a purer atmosphere of unyielding impartiality and
absolute fairness, let us take up some of the rights granted by
law to the defendants....”</p>

<p class='c007'>The men of Norfolk County stood together as best they
knew, to defend their institutions against reds, slackers, foreign
agitators. Twelve doughboys trying a German spy would have
brought the same verdict. “Damn them, they ought to hang
them anyway” was the foreman’s opinion.</p>

<p class='c007'>That was the history of the case from the outside. What
was happening to the two men in jail? Hope and despair in
sickening alternations, and then at last a sort of numbness. They,
each of them, had moments of breakdown. At one time Vanzetti
was put in a cell near the heating plant in Charlestown jail from
which he could hear the hammering of men getting the electric
chair ready for an execution. It wore on his nerves until the
prison authorities became alarmed and sent him to the State
Asylum for observation. There he was found to be perfectly sane.</p>

<p class='c007'>But Vanzetti serving out his sentence at Charlestown, at
least has work to keep him busy. In Dedham jail there is no
provision for giving work to prisoners awaiting sentence.
Except for the daily hour of exercise, Sacco has spent the whole
six years shut up in a cell. At first he used to go through all
sorts of exercises to keep himself fit; but inevitably the hopelessness
of it got to him. He went on a hunger strike. After
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>thirtyone days he was removed, a wreck, to the State Farm at
Bridgewater. There he was allowed to do outside work. Once
he was well he was moved back to Dedham again for more days
and weeks and months of waiting. The thing that keeps these
two men alive and sane is their faith in themselves as champions,
martyrs of the working class. Vanzetti is very fond of the
phrase of St. Augustine. <i>The blood of martyrs is the seed of
liberty.</i></p>

<p class='c007'>For through the bars and walls of their jails these men
must have felt an inkling of the great heroic shadows they
throw on the minds of working men all over the world. In
Russia, in Germany, in France, in the Argentine, people have
been profoundly moved by every step in the case. There have
been meetings, parades, bombs thrown, heads broken for Sacco
and Vanzetti, among men whose languages they may never
know, the names of whose towns they never heard. History is
made up of these sudden searchlights that for a moment make
gigantic the drama of a single humble man.</p>

<p class='c007'>The tangible proof of this feeling is in the contributions
that pour in steadily to the Defense Committee, mostly collected
from poor people, in small sums, from people to whom giving up
a dollar or two means missing meals or cigarettes or moving
picture shows. In the month of June 1926 contributions came
in from Chicago, Newark, Pensacola, Fla., Kalispell, Mont.,
Baltimore, Bound Rock, N. J., Bass River, Mass., New York,
Buffalo, Boston, Sandusky, Detroit, Zanesville, O., San Diego,
Oshkosh, Tulsa, London, England, Pueblo, Colo., Coney Island,
Balboa, San Francisco&#160;... and a couple of hundred other places.
Whatever the outcome, the passionate effort evoked by this case
will have been a great proof, if not of working class strength, at
least of working class solidarity.</p>

<p class='c007'>With the backing of the Italian population of the towns
round Boston and of a few liberal-minded Americans of old
families who had enough imagination and good citizenship to
see that justice was dangerously miscarrying, the Defense Committee
has carried on the case. They have been gravely
hampered by a lack of knowledge of American customs, and by
the direct action of certain underground forces. There were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>found to be undercover men working as collectors. Frank R.
Lopez, an active member of the Committee, was deported to
Spain. Then there was the still unsolved De Falco case.</p>

<p class='c007'>One morning in January 1921 a certain Angelina De Falco,
who claimed to be a court interpreter at Dedham, called at the
office of the Defense Committee accompanied by a certain Cicchetti
of Providence and offered to get Sacco off in the trial that
was to come. After several meetings during which the woman
tried to gain the confidence of Felicani and Guadagni, two of
the members of the Committee, she declared herself to be an
emissary of District Attorney Katzmann and of the clerk of the
court at Dedham. More meetings in restaurants and cafes. At
length she made them believe that for a certain sum of money she
could get off both Sacco and Vanzetti. But at the next interview
she came back to her original statement that she could only get
Sacco off; Vanzetti was too difficult on account of the previous
conviction. Then Guadagni said there was nothing doing. The
committee was out to prove the innocence of both men. She
said that it would cost a great deal; the District Attorney and
his assistants and the foreman of the jury would all have to be
fixed; there would be a mock trial and the two men would be
acquitted. The morning of January 5th Mrs. De Falco telephoned
the Committee, presumably from Dedham, that everything was
O. K. The seventh they were supposed to go to Dedham to settle
the matter.</p>

<p class='c007'>The lawyers for the defense, fearing a trap, suggested that
Mrs. De Falco be invited to discuss terms in Boston instead
of in Dedham. A good deal annoyed she came into the office at
32 Battery Street. A dictaphone had been put in to register the
conversation. There in the presence of Felicani, Guadagni, Mrs.
Sproul and Orciani she repeated her proposition. The price of
the two men’s liberty was forty thousand dollars. It was
explained to her that they had no such sum on hand. She said
that if an advance of five thousand was paid, the case would be
adjourned till the autumn session in order to give the Committee
all summer to raise the money.</p>

<p class='c007'>“And if the money is not raised will they be convicted?”
asked Mrs. Sproul and Guadagni. “Certainly,” replied Angelina
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>De Falco. Negotiations dragged on. Chief Counsel Moore was
of the opinion that they ought to swear out a complaint and
have her arrested. They did so. The case was tried before
Judge Francis Murray in Boston, who dismissed the charges,
completely exonerating Mr. Katzmann, ruling that Mrs. De
Falco had been ‘indiscreet’, but not guilty of a criminal act.</p>

<p class='c007'>Of course Mrs. De Falco may simply have been trying to
play a little game on her own, but the ugly doubt remains that
there may have been more to it than that. If you turn back to
the Boston papers of that period you will find that certain
scandalous disclosures were being made as to the actions of the
district attorneys of Suffolk and Middlesex counties.</p>

<p class='c007'>Anyway that’s the last that was heard of Angelina De
Falco. The mystery is still unsolved.</p>

<p class='c010'>What is going to be done if the Supreme Judicial Court
continues to refuse Sacco and Vanzetti a new trial? Are Sacco
and Vanzetti going to burn in the Chair?</p>

<p class='c007'>The conscience of the people of Massachusetts must be
awakened. Working people, underdogs, reds know instinctively
what is going on. The same thing has happened before. But the
average law-admiring, authority-respecting citizen does not
know. For the first time, since Judge Thayer’s last denial of
motions for a new trial, there has been a certain awakening
among the influential part of the community, the part of the
community respected by the press and the bench and the pulpit.
Always there have been notable exceptions, but up to now these
good citizens have had no suspicion that anything but justice
was being meted out by the courts. Goaded by the <cite>New York
World</cite> editorials, by Chief Counsel Thompson’s eloquence, by the
<cite>Boston Herald’s</cite> courageous change of front, they are getting
uneasy. It remains to be seen what will come of this uneasiness.
The <cite>Boston Herald</cite> suggests an impartial commission to review
the whole case. All that is needed is that the facts of the case
be generally known.</p>

<p class='c007'>Everyone must work to that end, no matter what happens,
that the facts of the case may be known so that no one can
plead ignorance, so that if these men are killed, everyone in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>State, everyone in the country will have the guilt on them. So
that no one can say “I would have protested but I didn’t know
what was being done.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Tell your friends, write to your congressmen, to the political
bosses of your district, to the newspapers. Demand the truth
about Sacco and Vanzetti. Call meetings, try to line up trade
unions, organizations, clubs, put up posters. Demand the truth
about Sacco and Vanzetti.</p>

<p class='c007'>If the truth had been told they would be free men today.</p>

<p class='c007'>If the truth is not told they will burn in the Chair in
Charlestown Jail. If they die what little faith many millions
of men have in the chance of Justice in this country will die
with them.</p>

<p class='c007'>Save Sacco and Vanzetti.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United

considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
